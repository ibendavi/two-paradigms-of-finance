# ERA 1: THE CONSENSUS (1720-1957)
# ============================================================

- year: 1720
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Archibald Hutcheson"
  title: "An Estimate of the Value of South-Sea Stock"
  quote: >
    Computes the 'intrinsick value' of South Sea Company shares by capitalizing
    earnings at observed market yields — finding the stock 3-5x overvalued.
    The first known systematic equity valuation.
  note_slug: Valuation_Hutcheson1720_EarliestEquityValuation

- year: 1795
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "William Fairman"
  title: "The Stocks Examined and Compared"
  quote: >
    First systematic comparison of all securities by yield — government bonds, East India stock,
    canal shares — ranked in a single table. Yield as the universal comparator.
  note_slug: Valuation_Fairman1795_FirstYieldComparison

- year: 1910
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Edward Sherwood Mead"
  title: "Corporation Finance"
  quote: >
    Uses 'capitalized earning power' as the basis for stock valuation, but never writes
    the formula V = E/r. The concept exists; the mathematics hasn't arrived yet.
  note_slug: Valuation_Mead1910_CorporationFinance

- year: 1920
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Arthur Stone Dewing"
  title: "The Financial Policy of Corporations"
  quote: >
    The dominant pre-theoretical textbook. Earning power is recognized as the basis
    for capitalization, but no formal valuation formula. 'Trading on the equity' is the route to higher EPS.
  note_slug: Valuation_Dewing1920_FinancialPolicy

- year: 1924
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Charles Gerstenberg"
  title: "Financial Organization and Management of Business"
  quote: >
    First textbook to write V = E/r explicitly. 'The rate that attracts capital to the particular
    corporation' — a capitalization rate from market comparables, not a theoretical model.
  note_slug: Valuation_Gerstenberg1924_CorpFinTextbook

- year: 1925
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Ralph Badger"
  title: "Valuation of Industrial Securities"
  quote: >
    Establishes the practitioner's earnings capitalization framework: earning power is 'the paramount
    criterion of value,' capitalized at rates determined by comparables and risk assessment.
  note_slug: Valuation_Badger1925_EarningsCapitalization

- year: 1934
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Benjamin Graham & David Dodd"
  title: "Security Analysis"
  quote: >
    'Intrinsic value = that value which is justified by the facts.' Value is earning power
    times an appropriate multiplier. The multiplier comes from comparables and judgment, not a discount rate model.
  note_slug: Valuation_GrahamDodd1940_SecurityAnalysis

- year: 1938
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "John Burr Williams"
  title: "The Theory of Investment Value"
  quote: >
    'A stock is worth only what you can get out of it.' First rigorous algebraic presentation
    of the dividend discount model: V = sum of discounted future dividends. Academic theory catches up
    to practitioner intuition — but practitioners won't adopt the formula for decades.
  note_slug: Valuation_Williams1938_InvestmentValue

- year: 1940
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Guthmann & Dougall"
  title: "Corporate Financial Policy"
  quote: >
    Leverage is 'trading on the equity' — using cheap debt to boost returns to shareholders.
    This is the EPS maximization logic, stated plainly, 18 years before Modigliani-Miller.
  note_slug: Valuation_GuthmannDougall1940_CorporateFinancialPolicy

- year: 1951
  era: consensus
  paradigm: pre-split
  author: "Joel Dean"
  title: "Capital Budgeting"
  quote: >
    Invents the cost-of-capital hurdle rate for investment decisions. But Dean's cost of equity
    IS the earnings yield: 'debt capital costs about 3 percent, while equity capital costs
    10 percent or better in terms of current earnings.'

# ============================================================
# ERA 2: THE REVOLUTION (1952-1963)
# ============================================================

- year: 1952
  era: revolution
  paradigm: transitional
  author: "Harry Markowitz"
  title: "Portfolio Selection"
  quote: >
    Introduces mean-variance optimization — the mathematical foundation for a risk-based
    cost of equity. For the first time, risk can be quantified, not just described.
  note_slug: Valuation_Markowitz1959_PortfolioSelection

- year: 1958
  era: revolution
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Modigliani & Miller"
  title: "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment"
  quote: >
    'The market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure.'
    Capital structure irrelevance — which only makes sense if you DON'T think about leverage
    as an EPS-boosting tool. The foundational theorem of modern corporate finance.
  note_slug: Valuation_ModiglianiMiller1958_CostOfCapital

- year: 1961
  era: revolution
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Miller & Modigliani"
  title: "Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares"
  quote: >
    Dividend policy is irrelevant — only investment policy matters. Shows the equivalence
    of four valuation approaches, all yielding the same answer under perfect markets.
  note_slug: Valuation_MillerModigliani1961_DividendPolicy

- year: 1962
  era: revolution
  paradigm: transitional
  author: "J. Fred Weston"
  title: "Managerial Finance"
  quote: >
    The last major textbook to use E/P as the cost of equity. Shows with a worked example that
    EPS maximization and value maximization give OPPOSITE answers for the debt-vs-equity choice.
    Puts 'practical' in scare quotes. The Rosetta Stone of the paradigm split.
  note_slug: Textbook_Weston1962_ManagerialFinance

- year: 1963
  era: revolution
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Ezra Solomon"
  title: "The Theory of Financial Management"
  quote: >
    'The goal is the maximization of the present worth of those who own the enterprise —
    although this is frequently stated in terms of the maximization of long-run earnings.'
    The first textbook to explicitly replace EPS maximization with value maximization.
    Commissioned by the Ford Foundation to professionalize business education.

# ============================================================
# ERA 3: THE GREAT DIVERGENCE (1964-present)
# ============================================================

- year: 1964
  era: divergence
  paradigm: academic
  author: "William Sharpe"
  title: "Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium"
  quote: >
    E(R) = Rf + beta x (Rm - Rf). The CAPM provides a theoretically derived cost of equity —
    replacing the market-observed earnings yield with a model-based required return.
    The practitioner's cap rate is now 'wrong.'
  note_slug: Valuation_Sharpe1964_CAPM

- year: 1973
  era: divergence
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Black & Scholes"
  title: "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities"
  quote: >
    Equity is a call option on the firm's assets. Closed-form option pricing via no-arbitrage.
    Finance becomes applied mathematics — the furthest departure from practitioner intuition.
  note_slug: Valuation_BlackScholes1973_OptionPricing

- year: 1973
  era: divergence
  paradigm: practitioner
  author: "John Pringle"
  title: "Price/Earnings Ratios, Earnings per Share, and Financial Management"
  quote: >
    Documents that managers and investors continue to use P/E ratios and EPS as primary
    decision metrics, despite academic theory declaring them irrelevant.
    The practice persists.
  note_slug: EPS_Pringle1973_PriceEarningsRatiosEPSFinancialManagement

- year: 1974
  era: divergence
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Joel Stern"
  title: "Earnings Per Share Don't Count"
  quote: >
    A direct assault from the academic side: 'There is no analytical connection whatsoever
    between a company's price/earnings ratio and its cost of equity capital.'
    The academy tells practitioners they're wrong.
  note_slug: EPS_Stern1974_EarningsPerShareDontCount

- year: 2000
  era: divergence
  paradigm: academic
  author: "Brealey & Myers"
  title: "Principles of Corporate Finance (6th ed.)"
  quote: >
    Three separate chapters demolishing EPS reasoning: the PVGO decomposition, the Macbeth Spot
    Removers leverage example, and the Bootstrap Game for M&A. The most influential textbook
    needs three demolitions — proving the practice is alive and well.
  note_slug: Brealey_Myers_EPS_Treatment_6th7thEd

- year: 2001
  era: divergence
  paradigm: practitioner
  author: "Graham & Harvey"
  title: "The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance"
  quote: >
    Survey of 392 CFOs reveals a gap between theory and practice: firms still use payback period,
    managers use 'gut feel' for risk, and P/E-based reasoning persists in M&A decisions.
  note_slug: Valuation_GrahamHarvey2001_TheoryPracticeCorporateFinance

- year: 2005
  era: divergence
  paradigm: practitioner
  author: "Graham, Harvey & Rajgopal"
  title: "The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting"
  quote: >
    The definitive survey evidence: 80% of CFOs would cut R&D to meet an EPS target.
    55% would delay a positive-NPV project. Earnings are 'in a class by themselves.'
    Managers maximize EPS, not NPV.
  note_slug: EPS_GrahamHarveyRajgopal2005_EconomicImplicationsCorporateReporting

- year: 2012
  era: divergence
  paradigm: practitioner
  author: "Aswath Damodaran"
  title: "Investment Valuation (3rd ed.)"
  quote: >
    'Most valuations done in the real world are relative valuations' using P/E multiples.
    The leading modern valuation authority inadvertently confirms that practitioners never
    adopted DCF as their primary method.
  note_slug: Valuation_Damodaran2012_InvestmentValuation

- year: 2019
  era: divergence
  paradigm: practitioner
  author: "Heitor Almeida"
  title: "Is It Time to Get Rid of Earnings-per-Share (EPS)?"
  quote: >
    Documents how share repurchases are overwhelmingly motivated by EPS accretion, that managers
    routinely sacrifice NPV for EPS, and asks whether the metric should be abolished entirely.
    The EPS paradigm is stronger than ever.
