      label: "Damodaran 2012"

  evidence:
    - slug: Valuation_MillerModigliani1961_DividendPolicy
      label: "M&M 1961"
    - slug: Valuation_Lintner1956_DistributionOfIncomes
      label: "Lintner 1956"

- concept: "M&A valuation"
  academic: "NPV of synergies; acquirer should not overpay"
  practitioner: "Is the deal EPS-accretive or dilutive? EPS accretion = good deal"
  evidence:

  academic: "Accept all positive-NPV projects; reject negative-NPV"

  evidence:
    - slug: Valuation_Dean1951_CapitalBudgeting
      label: "Dean 1951"

- concept: "Role of frictions"
  academic: "Essential — taxes, information asymmetry, agency costs explain every corporate policy"
