    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Brealey &amp; Myers's <em>Principles of Corporate Finance</em> (6th ed. 2000, 7th ed. 2003) -- the most influential corporate finance textbook of the post-MM era -- treats EPS as a <strong>dangerous distraction</strong> from the correct objective of maximizing net present value. The book systematically teaches students that EPS increases from leverage and mergers are illusory, that the earnings-price ratio is not the same as the market capitalization rate, and that managers who focus on EPS are making logical errors. EPS is addressed in three major set-piece arguments -- the stock price decomposition (Ch. 4), the leverage/EPS fallacy (Ch. 17), and the Bootstrap Game in mergers (Ch. 33) -- each designed to inoculate students against the practitioner instinct to maximize earnings per share.</p>

      <h2>1. The Firm's Stated Objective: Maximize NPV, Not Profits</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 states the objective with crystalline clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Here we will come to the fundamental objective of corporate finance: maximizing the current market value of the firm's outstanding shares.&quot; (Ch. 2, p. 13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument proceeds in three steps (Section 2.3, &quot;A Fundamental Result&quot;):</p>
<ol>
<li>A financial manager should act in the interests of the firm's owners, its stockholders.</li>
<li>But stockholders do not need the manager's help to achieve their preferred time pattern of consumption -- they can do that on their own in capital markets.</li>
<li>&quot;How then can the financial manager help the firm's stockholders? There is only one way: by increasing the market value of each stockholder's stake in the firm. The way to do that is to seize all investment opportunities that have a positive net present value.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>The passage then delivers a one-line instruction to managers: <strong>&quot;Maximize net present value.&quot;</strong></p>
<h3>The Explicit Rejection of &quot;Maximizing Profits&quot;</h3>
<p>Immediately after establishing the NPV rule, B&amp;M address the alternative objective head-on under the heading &quot;Other Corporate Goals&quot; (p. 22):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sometimes you hear managers speak as if the corporation has other goals. For example, they may say that their job is to maximize profits. That sounds reasonable. After all, don't shareholders prefer to own a profitable company rather than an unprofitable one? But taken literally, profit maximization doesn't make sense as a corporate objective. Here are three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>'Maximizing profits' leaves open the question, Which year's profits? Shareholders might not want a manager to increase next year's profits at the expense of profits in later years.</li>
<li>A company may be able to increase future profits by cutting its dividend and investing the cash. That is not in the shareholders' interest if the company earns only a low return on the investment.</li>
<li>Different accountants may calculate profits in different ways. So you may find that a decision which improves profits in one accountant's eyes will reduce them in the eyes of another.&quot;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the foundational framing. From the very start of the textbook, &quot;maximize profits&quot; (and by extension, &quot;maximize EPS&quot;) is presented as confused, ambiguous, and wrong. The correct objective is maximize NPV.</p>
<h2>2. Section 4.4: &quot;The Link Between Stock Price and Earnings per Share&quot;</h2>
<p>This is the textbook's most sustained engagement with EPS as a pricing concept. It is carefully constructed to show that the earnings-price ratio is NOT the market capitalization rate except under restrictive conditions.</p>
<h3>The No-Growth Case: Where E/P = r</h3>
<p>B&amp;M begin with the only case where EPS-based pricing works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Imagine first the case of a company that does not grow at all. It does not plow back any earnings and simply produces a constant stream of dividends. Its stock would be rather like the perpetual bond described in the last chapter. Remember that the return on a perpetuity is equal to the yearly cash flow divided by the present value. The expected return on our share would thus be equal to the yearly dividend divided by the share price (i.e., the dividend yield). Since all the earnings are paid out as dividends, the expected return is also equal to the earnings per share divided by the share price (i.e., the earnings-price ratio).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The formula: <strong>Expected return = dividend yield = earnings-price ratio = EPS/P</strong></p>
<p>For a no-growth firm with price $100 and EPS $10: r = EPS/P = 10/100 = .10 = 10%.</p>
<h3>The Growth Case: Where E/P Fails</h3>
<p>But then comes the critical complication. For growing firms that reinvest, the earnings-price ratio <strong>understates</strong> the capitalization rate because price includes the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The earnings-price ratio, therefore, equals: EPS/P = r(1 - PVGO/P). It will underestimate r if PVGO is positive and overestimate it if PVGO is negative. The latter case is less likely, since firms are rarely forced to take projects with negative net present values.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Table 4.3: The Key Numerical Demonstration</h3>
<p>This table (6th ed., p. 73) is one of the most important pedagogical exhibits in the book. It shows the effect on stock price of investing $10 (EPS) at year 1 at different rates of return:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Project NPV</th>

</table>
<p>The crucial lesson: <strong>&quot;the earnings-price ratio measured in terms of EPS in year 1, equals the market capitalization rate (r) only when the new project's NPV = 0.&quot;</strong> When the project has positive NPV, the earnings-price ratio <em>understates</em> the true capitalization rate.</p>
<p>B&amp;M then drive the point home with italicized emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Note that the earnings-price ratio, measured in terms of EPS(1), equals the market capitalization rate (r) <strong>only</strong> when the new project's NPV = 0. This is an extremely important point -- <strong>managers frequently make poor financial decisions because they confuse earnings-price ratios with the market capitalization rate.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The PVGO Decomposition</h3>
<p>The stock price decomposition formula is:</p>
<p><strong>P = EPS/r + PVGO</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPS/r = capitalized value of earnings under a no-growth policy</li>
<li>PVGO = present value of growth opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 4.4 (p. 76) shows estimated PVGOs for real companies in 1999:</p>

<p>This is meant to show that for growth stocks, earnings capitalization (EPS/r) captures only a small fraction of the stock price. Most of the value comes from PVGO.</p>
<h3>&quot;What Do Price-Earnings Ratios Mean?&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The price-earnings ratio is part of the everyday vocabulary of investors in the stock market. People casually refer to a stock as 'selling at a high P/E.' ... Unfortunately, some financial analysts are confused about what price-earnings ratios really signify and often use the ratio in odd ways.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Does a high P/E indicate a low market capitalization rate, r? No. There is <strong>no reliable association</strong> between a stock's price-earnings ratio and the capitalization rate r.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ratio of EPS to P measures r only if PVGO = 0 and only if reported EPS is the average future earnings the firm could generate under a no-growth policy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;What Do Earnings Mean?&quot;</h3>
<p>B&amp;M's final warning in this section (p. 77):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the earnings that firms report are book, or accounting, figures, and as such reflect a series of more or less arbitrary choices of accounting methods. Almost any firm's reported earnings can be changed substantially by adopting different accounting procedures. A switch in the depreciation method used for reporting purposes directly affects EPS, for example... We shall discuss the biases in accounting income and profitability measurements in Chapter 12; after we have used present value concepts to develop measures of true, economic income, we just want you to remember that <strong>accounting earnings are slippery animals.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. Chapter 17: Leverage and EPS -- The Macbeth Spot Removers Example</h2>
<p>This is the textbook's direct assault on the argument that leverage is good because it boosts EPS. B&amp;M construct a careful numerical example using &quot;Macbeth Spot Removers&quot; to show that while leverage mechanically increases expected EPS, it does not increase the share price.</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>Macbeth is entirely equity-financed: 1,000 shares at $10, total value $10,000. Expected operating income $1,500, EPS = $1.50, return = 15%.</p>
<p>Ms. Macbeth, the president, proposes issuing $5,000 of debt at 10% interest to repurchase 500 shares. This changes the capital structure to 50% debt / 50% equity.</p>
<h3>The EPS Increase</h3>
<p>Under the proposed leverage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected operating income: $1,500</li>
<li>Interest: $500</li>
<li>Equity earnings: $1,000</li>
<li>Shares outstanding: 500</li>
<li><strong>Expected EPS: $2.00</strong> (up from $1.50)</li>
<li>Expected return on shares: 20% (up from 15%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 17.1 plots EPS against operating income for both the all-equity and 50% debt structures, showing the &quot;leverage effect&quot; graphically -- the levered EPS line is steeper, crossing the unlevered line at the break-even operating income of $1,000.</p>
<h3>The Killer Response</h3>
<p>Ms. Macbeth argues leverage helps shareholders because expected EPS rises from $1.50 to $2.00. B&amp;M's response is devastating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As financial manager of Macbeth Spot Removers, you reply as follows: 'I agree that leverage will help the shareholder as long as our income is greater than $1,000. But your argument ignores the fact that Macbeth's shareholders have the alternative of borrowing on their own account.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B&amp;M show that any investor can replicate the leveraged payoff by borrowing personally (homemade leverage), so the firm's leverage decision cannot create value.</p>
<h3>The Key Quote</h3>
<p>The textbook's central verdict on leverage and EPS (p. 472, <strong>emphasis in original</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Leverage increases the expected stream of earnings per share but <em>not</em> the share price.</strong> The reason is that the change in the expected earnings stream is exactly offset by a change in the rate at which the earnings are capitalized.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the MM Proposition II argument: when the firm levers up, expected EPS rises from $1.50 to $2.00 (a 33% increase), but the earnings-price ratio also rises from 15% to 20%. The price remains $10:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<th>All Equity</th>
<th>50% Debt</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Expected EPS</td>
<td>$1.50</td>
<td>$2.00</td>

<tr>
<td>Price per share</td>
<td>$10</td>
<td>$10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expected return on share</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The share price does not change because the higher expected earnings are discounted at a correspondingly higher rate.</p>
<h3>Two Warnings on WACC</h3>
<p>B&amp;M then give two explicit warnings (p. 477):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Warning 1:</strong> Shareholders want management to increase the firm's value. They are more interested in being rich than in owning a firm with a low weighted-average cost of capital.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Warning 2:</strong> Trying to minimize the weighted-average cost of capital seems to encourage logical short circuits like the following. Suppose that someone says, 'Shareholders demand -- and deserve -- higher expected rates of return than bondholders do. Therefore debt is the cheaper capital source. We can reduce the weighted-average cost of capital by borrowing more.' But this doesn't follow if the extra borrowing leads stockholders to demand a still higher expected rate of return.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>4. Chapter 33: The Bootstrap Game</h2>
<p>This section, placed under the heading &quot;33.2 Some Dubious Reasons for Mergers,&quot; is B&amp;M's set-piece argument against EPS-accretive mergers. They call it the &quot;bootstrap&quot; or &quot;chain letter&quot; game.</p>
<h3>The Example: World Enterprises Acquires Muck and Slurry</h3>
<p>Table 33.2 presents:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Key mechanics: World Enterprises (P/E = 20) acquires Muck and Slurry (P/E = 10) by issuing 50,000 of its own shares (at $40) for 100,000 M&amp;S shares (at $20). Total earnings double, but shares increase by only 50%. <strong>EPS jumps from $2.00 to $2.67 -- a 33% increase -- despite no economic gain whatsoever.</strong></p>
<h3>Why It's Illusory</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We call this the <em>bootstrap effect</em> because there is no real gain created by the merger and no increase in the two firms' combined value. Since the stock price is unchanged, the price-earnings ratio falls (line 3).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 33.1 illustrates: before the merger, $1 invested in World Enterprises bought 5 cents of current earnings and rapid growth; $1 in M&amp;S bought 10 cents of current earnings but slower growth. After the merger, $1 in the combined firm buys 6.7 cents of current earnings but slower growth than World Enterprises alone. <strong>It's a trade-off of growth for current earnings, not a value creation.</strong></p>
<h3>The Chain Letter Mechanism</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You should now see how to play the bootstrap, or 'chain letter,' game. Suppose that you manage a company enjoying a high price-earnings ratio. The reason why it is high is that investors anticipate rapid growth in future earnings. You achieve this growth not by capital investment, product improvement, or increased operating efficiency but by the purchase of slow-growing firms with low price-earnings ratios. The long-run result will be slower growth and a depressed price-earnings ratio, but in the short run earnings per share can increase dramatically. If this fools investors, you may be able to achieve higher earnings per share without suffering a decline in your price-earnings ratio. But to <em>keep</em> fooling investors, you must continue to expand by merger <em>at the same compound rate</em>. Obviously you cannot do this forever; one day expansion must slow down or stop. Then earnings growth will cease, and your house of cards will fall.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Final Warning</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This kind of game is not played so often now. But there is still a widespread belief that a firm should not acquire companies with higher price-earnings ratios than its own. Of course you know better than to believe that low-P/E stocks are cheap and high-P/E stocks are dear. If life were as simple as that, we should all be wealthy by now. <strong>Beware of false prophets who suggest that you can appraise mergers just on the basis of their immediate impact on earnings per share.</strong>&quot;</p>

<h2>Significance for the EPS Paradigm Project</h2>
<p>Brealey &amp; Myers is arguably the single most important vehicle for transmitting the post-MM NPV paradigm to generations of finance students and MBA graduates. Several observations are critical:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The book explicitly acknowledges that managers DO focus on EPS.</strong> The leverage example (Ms. Macbeth's argument) and the Bootstrap Game are presented precisely because these are real managerial arguments that B&amp;M need to rebut. The book would not need three separate set-piece demolitions of EPS reasoning if the practice were not widespread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rebuttal depends entirely on the MM framework.</strong> The argument that leverage does not create value despite boosting EPS rests on the assumption that the market will re-rate the P/E ratio to offset the earnings increase. If instead the market uses a relatively stable P/E from comps (as the EPS paradigm proposes), then Ms. Macbeth's argument works: boosting EPS at a stable P/E increases the stock price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The PVGO decomposition is revealing.</strong> B&amp;M decompose P = EPS/r + PVGO and insist that EPS/r is only part of the story. But in the EPS paradigm, investors do not compute PVGO from projected future cash flows -- they simply apply a P/E multiple from comparable firms. The P/E itself implicitly incorporates growth expectations, but the investor's mental model is P = EPS x P/E, not P = EPS/r + PVGO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The &quot;slippery animals&quot; warning about accounting earnings cuts both ways.</strong> B&amp;M warn that earnings are accounting constructs subject to manipulation. But this is precisely what makes EPS the <em>operational</em> measure -- managers can control and target it, analysts can forecast it, and the market can price off it, in a way that future free cash flows (the DCF input) cannot be observed or verified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Bootstrap Game section reveals the textbook's deepest anxiety.</strong> The 1960s conglomerate wave -- in which firms like LTV, Gulf+Western, and ITT achieved spectacular growth through EPS-accretive acquisitions -- is the historical event that most clearly demonstrates the power of the EPS paradigm in practice. B&amp;M's framing as a &quot;chain letter&quot; and &quot;house of cards&quot; is normative, not positive: they are saying this <em>should not</em> work, not that it <em>did not</em> work. The conglomerates achieved real market value increases for years before the strategy collapsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The footnote is telling.</strong> The Bootstrap Game discussion cites S.C. Myers himself: &quot;A Framework for Evaluating Mergers,&quot; in S.C. Myers (ed.), <em>Modern Developments in Financial Management</em> (1976). Myers developed this argument specifically to counter practitioner reasoning about EPS accretion in mergers -- confirming that the practitioner instinct to maximize EPS was strong enough to require explicit academic rebuttal.</p>
