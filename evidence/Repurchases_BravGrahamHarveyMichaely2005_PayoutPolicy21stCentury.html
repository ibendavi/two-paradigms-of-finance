    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Brav, Graham, Harvey &amp; Michaely's 2005 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper surveys 384 financial executives (256 public, 128 private) and conducts 23 in-depth interviews about payout policy. The central findings for the EPS project: (1) EPS is a CRITICAL driver of repurchase decisions — 76.1% of executives say &quot;increasing earnings per share&quot; is an important or very important factor (Table 8, Row 2), and 67.6% say &quot;offsetting the dilutionary effect of stock option plans&quot; is important (Row 3). (2) Dividends and repurchases operate under fundamentally different regimes: dividends are nearly untouchable (93.8% try to avoid reducing DPS; 65% would raise external funds before cutting), while repurchases are flexible and made AFTER investment decisions (78.8% agree). (3) The Lintner model is weakening: the speed of adjustment has declined from a median of 0.74 (1950-1964) to 0.37 (1984-2002), and target payout ratios have declined from 0.35 to 0.21. (4) Academic theories receive little support: taxes are second-order, signaling theories are not supported (managers don't consciously use payout as costly signal), agency/discipline theories are rejected (87% say dividends don't discipline; 80% say repurchases don't), and clientele effects are weak. (5) The conclusion states the organizing principle: executives follow &quot;fairly straightforward decision rules&quot; including that &quot;given that an important portion of investors price stocks using earnings multiples, do not take actions that reduce EPS.&quot; For the EPS project, this paper provides survey evidence that EPS maximization is a conscious managerial objective governing repurchase policy, while dividends are governed by a separate conservatism regime — exactly the division the EPS paradigm predicts.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 483-487)</h3>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Updates Lintner's (1956) classic study with modern survey data. The payout landscape has changed dramatically: repurchases now exceed dividends, fewer firms pay dividends, and new motivations (EPS management, stock option dilution offset) have emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings previewed:</strong> Dividends remain conservative and sticky. Repurchases are more flexible and explicitly linked to EPS and stock price undervaluation. Academic payout theories (signaling, agency, clientele) receive little empirical support from the managers who make these decisions.</p>
<h3>Section 3: The Hierarchy — Investment, Dividends, Repurchases (pp. 490-495)</h3>
<p><strong>Investment decisions come first for repurchases but not clearly for dividends:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investment vs. dividends: rating = -0.3 (dividends nearly on par with investment)</li>
<li>Investment vs. repurchases: rating = +1.0*** (investment clearly first)</li>
<li>65% would raise external funds before cutting dividends</li>
<li>Only 16% would raise funds before reducing repurchases</li>
</ul>

<p>Market undervaluation is the #1 repurchase driver — consistent with the EPS paradigm's prediction that firms repurchase when the earnings yield (E/P) is high (stock price is low relative to earnings).</p>

<p>The speed of adjustment (SOA) has halved since Lintner's era, and the target payout ratio has declined from 35% to 21%. Payout ratio targeting is less central than it once was — firms now target the level or growth of DPS more than the payout ratio.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Academic Theories (pp. 507-516)</h3>
<p><strong>5.1 Taxes — Second-order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dividends were tax-disadvantaged (40% vs. 20% capital gains), but only 21.1% of dividend-payers cite taxes as important</li>
<li>Only 29.1% of repurchasers cite personal taxes as important</li>
<li>When asked directly whether the 2003 tax cut (reducing dividend tax to 15%) would lead to initiating dividends, 87% said probably not</li>
<li>Taxes are &quot;a consideration, but not a first-order concern&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.2 Clienteles — Weak support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>~50% believe paying dividends attracts retail investors; ~50% believe repurchases attract institutions</li>
<li>But institutions don't clearly prefer dividends over repurchases</li>
<li>Firms don't consciously use payout to attract specific clienteles</li>
<li>&quot;Institutions generally like dividends but institutions are not sought out to monitor firm&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.3 Agency/Discipline — Rejected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>87% say dividends do NOT impose discipline</li>
<li>80% say repurchases do NOT impose discipline</li>
<li>Only 8.5% say &quot;paying dividends to reduce cash, thereby disciplining our firm to make efficient decisions&quot; is important (Table 10, Panel B, Row 11)</li>
<li>In interviews, some admit &quot;money can burn a hole in our pocket&quot; but don't view payout as the solution</li>
<li>&quot;Most executives do not view payout policy as a means of self-imposing discipline&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.4 Signaling — Not supported:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>80% say payout conveys information (both dividends and repurchases)</li>
<li>But this is INFORMATION SHARING, not costly signaling</li>
<li>Only 4.4% use dividends to separate from competitors</li>
<li>Only 9.0% &quot;pass up profitable investments&quot; to signal via dividends (Table 4, Row 10)</li>
<li>Fewer than 1 in 20 view repurchase signaling as important</li>
<li>&quot;In no interview or survey response did managers argue that firms initiate dividends so that at some time in the future they might get an opportunity to separate themselves by not cutting&quot;</li>

<p><strong>EPS is the #2 repurchase factor after undervaluation.</strong> Three-fourths of survey respondents say increasing EPS is important. In interviews, &quot;the interviewees express great concern about the effects of repurchases on EPS. A number could cite precise numerical estimates of EPS given their repurchase program and what EPS would be without such a program.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The CFOs are split on HOW repurchases increase EPS:</strong> &quot;A notable portion of executives express the view that repurchasing shares reduces the total number of shares and therefore automatically increases EPS. Another set of managers understands that only if repurchases are carried out using funds that would otherwise not earn the cost of capital are they accretive to earnings.&quot; This confirms that some managers focus on cosmetic dilution (share count) while others understand the earnings yield condition (EPS/P &gt; r).</p>
<p><strong>Stock option dilution:</strong> Two-thirds feel offsetting ESO dilution is important, confirming Bens et al. (2003). &quot;Virtually no support exists for the idea that companies repurchase instead of use dividends because employee stock options are not dividend-protected&quot; (only 10.6%).</p>
<h3>Section 6: Payout Initiation (pp. 516-518)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 9 — Initiation horizons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>77% of non-dividend-payers say they will &quot;possibly never&quot; initiate dividends</li>
<li>56% of non-repurchasers say &quot;possibly never&quot; for repurchases</li>
<li>Firms would begin repurchasing when: stock is undervalued, excess cash exists, institutions demand it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table 10 — Initiation factors for repurchases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>#1: Market undervaluation (75.7%)</li>
<li>#2: Extra cash or marketable securities (60.0%)</li>
<li>#3: Market not fairly valuing firm (58.7%)</li>
<li>#7: Offsetting stock option dilution (50.7%)</li>
<li>#8: Increasing EPS (50.7%)</li>
<li>Nearly 90% of firms with LOW P/E ratios say market undervaluation could lead to repurchases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 7: Summary and Discussion (pp. 520-523)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 11 — Summary comparison of dividend vs. repurchase views (COMPREHENSIVE):</strong></p>
<p>Key contrasts for EPS project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EPS:</strong> &quot;Not important&quot; for dividends; &quot;Repurchase in an attempt to increase EPS is VERY IMPORTANT&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Stock options:</strong> &quot;Not important&quot; for dividends; &quot;Repurchase to offset stock option dilution is IMPORTANT&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Historical level:</strong> &quot;Very important. Do not cut dividends except in extreme circumstances&quot; vs. &quot;Not important&quot; for repurchases</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Dividends = &quot;Sticky. Inflexible. Smooth through time.&quot; Repurchases = &quot;Very Flexible. No need to smooth.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Cash cows:</strong> &quot;Expected to pay dividends. Dividend growth is very important&quot; vs. &quot;Expected to return capital, including repurchasing shares&quot;</li>
<li><strong>If starting over:</strong> &quot;Would keep dividend commitment minimized&quot; vs. &quot;Would rely heavily on repurchases to return capital to investors&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The concluding &quot;rules of the game&quot; (p. 523):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Executives tend to employ decision rules that are fairly straightforward... With respect to payout policy, the rules of the game include the following: expect a severe penalty for cutting dividends; do not deviate far from competitors; maintain a good credit rating; have a broad and diverse investor base; maintain flexibility; and, <strong>given that an important portion of investors price stocks using earnings multiples, do not take actions that reduce EPS.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final statement is remarkable — the paper explicitly acknowledges the EPS paradigm's pricing model (P = EPS x P/E) as the foundation for payout policy.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. EPS as #2 Repurchase Driver — From the Managers Themselves</h3>
<p>76.1% of executives say increasing EPS is important/very important for repurchase decisions. This is survey evidence that EPS maximization is a conscious, deliberate objective — not an unconscious bias, not a side effect of other motives, but an explicit goal. This is among the most direct pieces of evidence for the EPS paradigm.</p>
<h3>2. The &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; Quote Is a Direct Statement of the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>The conclusion's statement — &quot;given that an important portion of investors price stocks using earnings multiples, do not take actions that reduce EPS&quot; — is the EPS paradigm in one sentence. It combines: (a) investors price using P = EPS x P/E, (b) managers know this, (c) managers manage EPS accordingly. This is from four leading finance scholars writing in a top-3 journal.</p>
<h3>3. Dividends vs. Repurchases: Two Different Regimes</h3>
<p>The paper documents that dividends and repurchases operate under completely different regimes. Dividends are governed by conservatism and stickiness (the Lintner model). Repurchases are governed by EPS, stock undervaluation, and flexibility. The EPS paradigm applies primarily to the repurchase margin, not the dividend margin — and this paper confirms that distinction.</p>
<h3>4. Academic Theories Fail — A Vacuum for the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>The rejection of signaling (&lt; 5% support), agency/discipline (87% reject), and clientele theories for explaining payout means that the standard academic toolkit fails to explain what managers actually do. The EPS paradigm fills this vacuum: managers repurchase to boost EPS, not to signal, discipline, or attract clienteles.</p>
<h3>5. The Lintner Model Is Declining</h3>
<p>SOA down from 0.74 to 0.37, target payout down from 0.35 to 0.21. Firms are moving AWAY from the payout-ratio model and toward a DPS-level model. This is consistent with the EPS paradigm: what matters is not the fraction of earnings paid out (payout ratio) but the level of dividends and the EPS impact of repurchases. The unit of account is EPS, not the payout ratio.</p>
<h3>6. Market Undervaluation = High Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>The #1 repurchase driver — market undervaluation (86.4%) — is equivalent in the EPS paradigm to a high earnings yield (E/P). When E/P is high, the stock is &quot;cheap&quot; and repurchases are EPS-accretive (because EPS/P &gt; r). Managers calling this &quot;undervaluation&quot; are describing the same condition the EPS paradigm identifies as the accretion threshold.</p>
<h3>7. Nearly 90% of Low P/E Firms Would Repurchase</h3>
<p>The finding that ~90% of low P/E firms say undervaluation could lead to repurchases is exactly the EPS paradigm's prediction: low P/E = high E/P = repurchases are EPS-accretive, so firms repurchase. This is the cross-sectional implication of EPS/P &gt; r.</p>
<h3>8. &quot;If Starting Over&quot; — Repurchases Would Dominate</h3>
<p>Executives say they would keep dividends minimized and rely on repurchases if they could start fresh. This reveals the underlying preference: repurchases are the preferred payout tool because they are flexible, boost EPS, and can be timed to periods of undervaluation. Dividends exist only because of path dependence and the severe penalty for cutting.</p>
<h3>9. Taxes Are NOT the Primary Explanation</h3>
<p>The finding that taxes are second-order for both dividends (21.1% cite) and repurchases (29.1% cite) means the tax advantage of repurchases is NOT the main reason firms prefer them. The EPS paradigm offers the alternative: repurchases are preferred because they boost EPS, which is the metric that drives stock price. Taxes may facilitate this but are not the cause.</p>

<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> — &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Brav et al.'s finding that 67.6% cite ESO dilution offset as important confirms Bens et al.'s archival finding that ESO dilution drives repurchases.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> — &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show 37% of repurchase dollars are spent by firms trying to flip EPS surprise from negative to positive.

<li><strong>Grullon &amp; Michaely (2002)</strong> — &quot;Dividends, Share Repurchases, and the Substitution Hypothesis.&quot; Document the secular shift from dividends to repurchases.

<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — &quot;Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares.&quot; Brav et al. note that repurchase policy is &quot;better explained by the Miller and Modigliani (1961) framework than is dividend policy&quot; — repurchases are residual cash flow, made after investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; Find 44.8% use EPS as bonus metric. Brav et al. show that compensation is a motivation for earnings management more broadly, and EPS drives repurchase decisions specifically.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Brav et al. provide perhaps the clearest self-reported evidence for the EPS paradigm's payout prediction: managers repurchase to increase EPS (76.1%), offset ESO dilution (67.6%), and when stocks are undervalued (= high earnings yield, 86.4%). The &quot;rules of the game&quot; quote directly states the EPS paradigm's pricing model.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — This paper is the primary survey evidence for the dividends paper. Key insight: dividends are governed by conservatism and stickiness (the old Lintner regime), while repurchases are governed by EPS maximization (the new EPS regime). The two payout channels operate under different objective functions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — If 76.1% of executives say EPS drives repurchases, and falling interest rates make repurchases more EPS-accretive (lower after-tax r in the EPS/P &gt; r condition), then the secular decline in rates should increase aggregate repurchase activity — exactly the buyback boom the Meli paper documents.</li>
