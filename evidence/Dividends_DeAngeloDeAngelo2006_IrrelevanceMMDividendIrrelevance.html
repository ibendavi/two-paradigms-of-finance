    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's 2006 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper argues that the Modigliani-Miller (1961) dividend irrelevance theorem is itself irrelevant because MM's assumptions artificially rule out retention, mandating that firms distribute 100% of free cash flow (FCF) every period. Under MM's framework, D_t = FCF_t + S_t: dividends equal FCF plus any new stock issues, meaning firms MUST pay out all FCF — the only &quot;choice&quot; is whether to simultaneously issue stock and pay it back (a value-neutral round-trip). When retention is allowed (the realistic case), payout policy matters even in frictionless markets because managers can destroy value by retaining cash and investing in negative-NPV projects or simply hoarding. Two optimality conditions are needed for stockholder wealth maximization: (i) invest in all positive-NPV projects, AND (ii) distribute the full present value of FCF to stockholders. MM's theorem collapses these into one condition by hard-wiring (ii) into the assumptions. The paper introduces the &quot;capitalized payout ratio&quot; (CPR) — the PV of distributions divided by the PV of FCF — showing that the market &quot;really&quot; capitalizes expected distributions, not earnings or cash flows per se. For the EPS project, this paper is essential because it shows that the standard academic dismissal of payout policy (based on MM) rests on an assumption that eliminates the very decision being studied — and because it highlights that what the market capitalizes (the distribution stream) is closely related to earnings under the EPS paradigm.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Core Argument: MM Mandate 100% FCF Payout (pp. 293-301)</h3>
<p><strong>MM's dividend irrelevance</strong> says that, in frictionless markets, payout policy doesn't affect firm value. DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo show this result is trivially true because MM's assumptions eliminate the payout/retention choice entirely.</p>
<p>Under MM's assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D_t = X_t - I_t + S_t = FCF_t + S_t</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where X_t = earnings, I_t = investment, S_t = net new stock issues (negative = repurchases). Since S_t ≥ 0 in the simplest MM setup (or S_t can be any value), firms always distribute ALL FCF. The only &quot;flexibility&quot; is to simultaneously issue new stock (S_t &gt; 0) and pay it out as higher dividends — a value-neutral round trip.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates MM's constrained feasible set: all feasible payout policies lie on the line segment AW₁ where the PV of distributions equals the PV of FCF. Every point on this line has the same firm value — hence &quot;irrelevance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the realistic feasible set when retention is allowed: the expanded region V₂V₁W₁W₂. Now the firm CAN retain cash and destroy value (the shaded region below AW₁) by retaining FCF and investing in negative-NPV projects or holding idle cash. Payout policy matters because suboptimal retention is possible.</p>
<h3>Two Optimality Conditions (pp. 301-305)</h3>
<p>In the realistic case (retention allowed), maximizing stockholder wealth requires TWO conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Investment optimality:</strong> Take all positive-NPV projects, reject all negative-NPV projects</li>
<li><strong>Payout optimality:</strong> Distribute the full PV of FCF to stockholders</li>
</ol>
<p>MM's framework hard-wires condition (2) into the assumptions, so only condition (1) matters — giving the false impression that payout is irrelevant. But in reality, managers CAN violate condition (2) by retaining cash unnecessarily.</p>
<p><strong>The rational expectations constraint (Equation 2):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V₀ = PV(distributions) = PV(FCF) only if the firm distributes FCF optimally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the firm retains and wastes cash, PV(distributions) &lt; PV(FCF), and the stock price reflects this.</p>
<h3>Seven Objections and Rejoinders (pp. 305-308)</h3>
<p>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo address seven objections to their argument:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&quot;Firms can always liquidate&quot;</strong> — Liquidation is itself a payout policy; saying firms can liquidate concedes that payout policy matters.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Stockholders can sell shares for homemade dividends&quot;</strong> — Share sales are not equivalent to dividends when retention destroys value; selling shares just transfers the problem to the buyer.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Why would managers retain suboptimally?&quot;</strong> — Agency costs (Jensen 1986); but the point is not that they WILL, only that they CAN — the feasible set includes suboptimal retention.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;MM already acknowledged payout could matter with imperfections&quot;</strong> — The point is that payout matters even WITHOUT imperfections, once retention is allowed.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;This is just the agency cost story&quot;</strong> — No: agency costs create pressure for ACCELERATED payout, but the NEED to distribute FCF exists even with perfectly aligned managers. Agency costs intensify the problem, they don't create it.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Isn't this obvious?&quot;</strong> — Perhaps, but the profession has been misled by MM for decades.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The firm can commit to distribute&quot;</strong> — Commitment mechanisms are themselves payout policies; committing to distribute concedes that payout policy matters.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Capitalized Payout Ratio (CPR) (pp. 308-311)</h3>
<p>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo define the CPR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CPR = PV(distributions) / PV(FCF)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where PV(distributions) = Σ D_t/(1+r)^t and PV(FCF) = Σ FCF_t/(1+r)^t.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Stock price = PV(expected distributions) = CPR × PV(FCF). The market capitalizes the DISTRIBUTION stream, not earnings or cash flows directly. When CPR &lt; 1 (managers retain and waste some FCF), the stock trades below its potential value.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows the relation between CPR and firm value. MM's world constrains CPR = 1 always. In reality, CPR can range from 0 (full retention/waste) to above 1 (borrowing to distribute). Value is maximized at CPR = 1 (distribute full PV of FCF).</p>
<h3>Critique of Black's &quot;Dividend Puzzle&quot; (pp. 311-313)</h3>
<p>Fischer Black (1976) declared: &quot;Why do corporations pay dividends? ... The harder we look at the dividend picture, the more it seems like a puzzle.&quot; DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo argue Black's reasoning was flawed because it was based on MM's irrelevance result. Once retention is allowed, the &quot;puzzle&quot; dissolves: firms MUST pay dividends (or repurchase stock) to deliver value to stockholders. The puzzle is not why firms pay dividends — it's an artifact of taking MM's irrelevance theorem too literally.</p>
<h3>Implications for Payout Theory (pp. 313-314)</h3>
<p>The paper concludes that MM's irrelevance theorem has misled the profession into treating payout as a &quot;poor sister&quot; to investment policy. Because payout appeared irrelevant (under MM), researchers developed friction-based theories (signaling, clienteles, behavioral) to explain why firms pay dividends. But the real answer is simpler: firms pay dividends because stockholders need distributions to realize value. The &quot;trade-off theory of payout&quot; — balancing flotation costs and agency costs against the need to distribute FCF — is the natural framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;MM's (1961) dividend irrelevance theorem has conditioned generations of researchers to view payout policy as a 'poor sister' to investment policy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Market Capitalizes Distributions — Which Track Earnings</h3>
<p>The CPR framework says V₀ = PV(distributions). In the EPS paradigm, P = EPS × P/E. These are not contradictory — they are complementary. Distributions TRACK earnings: firms with higher EPS can and do distribute more to shareholders. The earnings yield (E/P) is the rate at which earnings are capitalized, and the distribution yield is the rate at which distributions are capitalized. For mature firms with stable payout ratios, the two are proportional. The EPS paradigm's focus on earnings capitalization is consistent with DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's emphasis on distributions.</p>
<h3>2. MM Irrelevance Eliminated the Payout Decision — The EPS Paradigm Restores It</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, payout policy is NOT irrelevant. Managers choose dividends and repurchases to maximize EPS. Repurchases boost EPS when the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax cost of debt financing; dividends are paid from earnings that cannot be reinvested at the earnings yield. DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's critique of MM — that irrelevance is an artifact of eliminating retention — supports the EPS paradigm's treatment of payout as a genuine corporate decision with real consequences for EPS.</p>
<h3>3. &quot;Two Optimality Conditions&quot; Maps onto the EPS Framework</h3>
<p>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's condition (i) — invest in positive-NPV projects — maps onto the EPS paradigm's investment rule: invest if the project's return exceeds the earnings yield (the market's required return on equity). Condition (ii) — distribute FCF — maps onto the EPS paradigm's payout rule: return cash to shareholders via repurchases (which boost EPS) when there are no EPS-accretive investments available.</p>
<h3>4. Black's Dividend &quot;Puzzle&quot; Dissolves in the EPS Paradigm Too</h3>
<p>Black (1976) called dividends a puzzle because MM said they shouldn't matter. In the EPS paradigm, there is no puzzle: dividends represent the portion of EPS that managers choose to distribute rather than retain. The payout ratio reflects the fraction of earnings for which managers see no EPS-accretive reinvestment opportunity. The &quot;puzzle&quot; exists only within the NPV paradigm where MM is the starting point.</p>
<h3>5. The CPR Concept Connects to Earnings Yields</h3>
<p>CPR = PV(distributions)/PV(FCF). In the EPS paradigm, the market prices the earnings stream, not the FCF stream. The relevant ratio is the earnings yield (E/P), which reflects the market's required return. When CPR &lt; 1 (managers waste cash), the effective earnings yield to investors is higher than the reported E/P — the market penalizes the firm with a lower P/E multiple. This is observable: firms with histories of wasteful retention (empire-building, poor capital allocation) trade at lower P/E multiples.</p>
<h3>6. The Critique Supports the Pre-MM View of Payout</h3>
<p>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's argument that MM's irrelevance is an artifact echoes the pre-MM tradition in which payout policy was always considered important. In the pre-MM world (the EPS paradigm's natural habitat), managers understood that shareholders valued dividends and that the payout decision was a real choice with consequences. MM's 1961 theorem disrupted this understanding in academia but never changed practitioner behavior — managers continued to treat payout as important, exactly as DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo argue they should.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — The EPS paradigm never accepted MM's irrelevance, so DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo's critique is natural: payout matters because it affects EPS (repurchases reduce shares, dividends are the residual payout from earnings). The MM irrelevance theorem was always irrelevant to practitioners.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The EPS-maximizing payout paper should cite DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo as showing that even within frictionless markets, payout matters once retention is allowed.

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo document that MM's theorem conditioned researchers to dismiss payout policy. The maxEPS paradigm paper argues that MM changed the academic objective function from EPS to NPV — DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo show one specific way this change was damaging.</li>
