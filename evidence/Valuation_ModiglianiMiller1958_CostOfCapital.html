    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>M&amp;M's 1958 AER paper proves three propositions: (I) firm value is independent of capital structure; (II) the cost of equity rises linearly with leverage; (III) the investment cutoff rate equals the unlevered cost of capital, independent of financing. The proof rests on an <strong>arbitrage argument</strong>: investors can replicate or undo corporate leverage through personal borrowing, so they will never pay a premium for it. M&amp;M cite Williams (1938) as having stated &quot;close equivalents of Proposition I&quot; but only &quot;by appealing to intuition rather than by attempting a proof.&quot; Fisher is NOT cited despite the paper effectively generalizing his separation theorem. The paper resolves the central unsolved problem of the prior literature — what discount rate to use — by showing it is rho_k (the capitalization rate for the firm's risk class), independent of how the firm is financed.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Proposition I: Capital Structure Irrelevance (p. 268)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>V_j = (S_j + D_j) = X̄_j / ρ_k, for any firm j in class k.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure and is given by capitalizing its expected return at the rate ρ_k appropriate to its class.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The firm's value depends ONLY on its expected operating income (X̄) and the capitalization rate for its risk class (ρ_k) — not on how that income is divided between debtholders and stockholders.</p>
<h3>Proposition II: Cost of Equity Under Leverage (p. 271)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>i_j = ρ_k + (ρ_k - r) · D_j/S_j</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The required return on equity rises linearly with the debt-to-equity ratio. The intercept is the unlevered cost of capital (ρ_k); the slope is the spread between ρ_k and the bond rate (r). <strong>The rising equity cost exactly offsets the benefit of &quot;cheap&quot; debt, keeping the weighted average cost of capital flat.</strong></p>
<h3>Proposition III: The Investment Cutoff Rate (p. 288)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cut-off point for investment in the firm will in all cases be ρ_k and will be completely unaffected by the type of security used to finance the investment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resolves the central question that plagued the prior literature: What discount rate should a firm use? Answer: ρ_k — the capitalization rate for an unlevered stream of the same risk class. Not the borrowing rate, not the current equity yield, not a weighted average that shifts with the financing mix.</p>
<h3>The Arbitrage Proof (pp. 269-271)</h3>
<p>The core innovation. If a levered firm is overvalued relative to an unlevered firm in the same risk class, an investor can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell the levered stock</li>
<li>Buy the unlevered stock</li>
<li>Borrow on personal account to replicate the leverage
This yields a higher return for the same risk → arbitrage drives values to equality.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reverse works for undervaluation. Key: investors can create &quot;homemade leverage&quot; (or undo leverage through mixed bond-stock portfolios), so corporate leverage per se has no value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Levered companies cannot command a premium over unlevered companies because investors have the opportunity of putting the equivalent leverage into their portfolio directly by borrowing on personal account.&quot; (p. 269)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Milk/Butter Fat Analogy (pp. 279-280)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our Proposition I states that a firm cannot reduce the cost of capital — i.e., increase the market value of the stream it generates — by securing part of its capital through the sale of bonds, even though debt money appears to be cheaper. This assertion is equivalent to the proposition that, under perfect markets, a dairy farmer cannot in general earn more for the milk he produces by skimming some of the butter fat and selling it separately, even though butter fat per unit weight, sells for more than whole milk.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Tax Effects (pp. 272-273, 293-296)</h3>
<p>With corporate income tax (rate τ) where interest is deductible:</p>
<ul>
<li>There IS a tax advantage to debt, but it is <strong>small</strong> — equity is only ~25% more expensive than debt, not 5x as the traditional view implied</li>
<li>&quot;The only difference in cost is that due to the tax effect, and its magnitude is simply the tax on the 'grossed up' interest payment&quot; (p. 295)</li>
<li>Paradoxically, &quot;the stockholders' gain from, and hence incentive to use, debt financing is actually smaller the lower the rate of interest&quot; (p. 296)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Earnings vs. Dividends (pp. 266, 287-288)</h3>
<p>M&amp;M's position is unambiguous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The stream is a stream of profits, not dividends. As long as management is presumed to be acting in the best interests of the stockholders, retained earnings can be regarded as equivalent to a fully subscribed, pre-emptive issue of common stock. Hence, for present purposes, the division of the stream between cash dividends and retained earnings in any period is a mere detail.&quot; (p. 266)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Devastating Example (pp. 289-291)</h3>
<p>A firm with ρ_k = 10% and r = 4% finances a project yielding 8% entirely with debt. The project appears profitable (8% &gt; 4% borrowing cost). But the equity value <strong>falls</strong> because 8% &lt; ρ_k = 10%. The correct cutoff is ρ_k, not the borrowing rate.</p>
<h2>Who Is Cited — And Who Is Not</h2>
<p><strong>Cited:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — acknowledged as having &quot;stated close equivalents of our Proposition I&quot; but &quot;by appealing to intuition rather than by attempting a proof&quot; (footnote 13, p. 271)</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1951)</strong> — cited as representative of the &quot;traditional view&quot; that M&amp;M attack; also cited for their own documentation of arbitrage opportunities (pp. 646-48)</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1952)</strong> — the main foil; formalized the &quot;net income&quot; vs. &quot;net operating income&quot; approaches</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — cited as &quot;accepted doctrine&quot; on investment policy</li>
<li><strong>Lutz &amp; Lutz (1951)</strong> — cited for the certainty case (builds on Fisher, but Fisher himself not cited)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOT cited:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irving Fisher</strong> — remarkable omission given that Proposition III effectively generalizes the Fisher Separation Theorem to uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>Markowitz</strong> — portfolio theory plays no role; mentioned only in a footnote acknowledging it would be needed for &quot;refinements&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Dewing, Bonbright, Gerstenberg</strong> — the pre-modern textbook tradition is invisible</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Arbitrage Revolution</h3>
<p>Before M&amp;M, propositions about finance were argued by intuition, authority, or appeal to market convention. M&amp;M introduced <strong>no-arbitrage reasoning</strong> — if a proposition about prices doesn't hold, show how to make a riskless profit, and the argument is done. This methodology would later generate Black-Scholes (1973) and the entire derivatives pricing framework.</p>
<h3>2. Williams Vindicated but Overshadowed</h3>
<p>Williams (1938) stated the Conservation of Investment Value = Proposition I twenty years earlier. M&amp;M acknowledge this but claim the proof is new. History has largely given M&amp;M the credit, despite Williams' priority. The key difference: Williams asserted it; M&amp;M proved it via arbitrage and derived its implications (Props II and III).</p>
<h3>3. The Discount Rate Problem Solved</h3>
<p>The &quot;unsolved problem&quot; identified by Bonbright (1937) — &quot;an admixture of tradition and guesswork&quot; — receives its first rigorous answer: ρ_k, the unlevered capitalization rate for the risk class. This is independent of capital structure. The remaining question (what determines ρ_k?) would require the CAPM (1964).</p>
<h3>4. Fisher's Ghost</h3>
<p>M&amp;M don't cite Fisher, but Fisher's fingerprints are everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposition III = Fisher Separation generalized to uncertainty</li>
<li>The arbitrage mechanism = Fisher's concept of market-mediated optimization</li>
<li>The milk/butter fat analogy ≈ Fisher's orchard/crop direction of causation
The intellectual debt is real but unacknowledged.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Graham &amp; Dodd as Foil</h3>
<p>M&amp;M use Graham &amp; Dodd simultaneously as (a) representative of the &quot;traditional view&quot; they attack and (b) evidence for their own position — citing Graham &amp; Dodd's documentation of persistent price discrepancies that the traditional view cannot explain. This dual use is ironic: Graham &amp; Dodd are both target and witness.</p>
