    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Ikenberry, Lakonishok &amp; Vermaelen's 1995 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper documents that the market significantly underreacts to open market share repurchase announcements. Using 1,239 announcements from 1980-1990, they find an average 2-day announcement return of only 3.54% — far less than implied by subsequent performance. Over the following four years, repurchasing firms earn 12.14% compounded abnormal returns (buy-and-hold). The underreaction is concentrated in &quot;value&quot; stocks (high book-to-market): value firms that announce repurchases earn 45.29% compounded abnormal returns over four years, while &quot;glamour&quot; stocks (low book-to-market) show no significant abnormal performance. Fama-French three-factor alphas confirm the pattern: value repurchasers earn 0.43%/month (t = 3.30), glamour repurchasers earn -0.30%/month (insignificant). The spread of 0.73%/month (8.76%/year) is robust across subperiods, measurement methods, and controls for takeovers and repeat announcements. The authors conclude that true undervaluation, not just signaling, motivates repurchases — particularly for value stocks — and that the market is slow to incorporate this information. For the EPS project, this paper demonstrates that repurchases are most effective (in terms of subsequent stock performance) precisely for firms where the EPS paradigm predicts repurchases are most accretive — high earnings yield (value) firms.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction and Hypotheses (pp. 181-185)</h3>
<p><strong>Two hypotheses about repurchases:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Traditional Signaling Hypothesis (TSH):</strong> Managers repurchase when they believe the stock is undervalued; the announcement signals this private information. If the market is efficient, prices should adjust immediately and fully — no post-announcement drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Underreaction Hypothesis (UH):</strong> The market treats repurchase announcements with skepticism and adjusts prices only gradually. Prices drift upward after the announcement as the undervaluation is slowly corrected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors favor the underreaction hypothesis, consistent with the growing literature showing that corporate events have protracted price adjustments (IPOs, SEOs, mergers).</p>
<p><strong>Why focus on open market repurchases?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open market programs are the most common form of repurchase</li>
<li>They involve no legal commitment to actually buy shares (unlike tender offers)</li>
<li>This flexibility means the signal is weaker and the market may be right to be skeptical</li>
<li>But the lack of commitment also means that actual undervaluation (not just signaling) may be the dominant motive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 2: Data (pp. 185-187)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sample:</strong> 1,239 open market repurchase announcements, January 1980 - December 1990</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Wall Street Journal (WSJ) announcements verified against CRSP and Compustat</li>
<li><strong>Average announced repurchase:</strong> 6.6% of shares outstanding</li>
<li><strong>Total dollar value:</strong> $142.6 billion (1990 dollars) for the full sample</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 3: Methodology (pp. 187-190)</h3>
<p>Two performance measurement approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CARs (cumulative abnormal returns):</strong> Monthly rebalancing against size-matched reference portfolios</li>
<li><strong>Buy-and-hold compounded returns:</strong> More realistic investment strategy; differences compound over long horizons</li>
</ol>
<p>Statistical inference via bootstrapping — randomly selecting 1,239 firms from the reference portfolio and computing pseudo-CARs, repeated 1,000 times to create the null distribution.</p>

<p>Small firms and firms explicitly citing undervaluation show larger announcement returns. But book-to-market quintile does NOT predict announcement returns — all quintiles show similar 3.3-3.6% CARs.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The market does not distinguish between value and glamour repurchasers at announcement — even though subsequent performance differs enormously.</p>

<p><strong>The spread is enormous:</strong> Value firms that repurchase earn 45.3% abnormal over 4 years. Glamour firms that repurchase earn zero abnormal. The entire long-run abnormal return comes from value stocks.</p>
<p>Cross-sectional regressions confirm: book-to-market is &quot;by far the strongest variable related to long-run performance,&quot; dominating size, fraction of shares announced, and prior returns.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Section 8: Conclusions (pp. 206-208)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The literature is rich with reasons for why companies repurchase their own stock, ranging from signaling to being a substitute for cash dividends. Yet managers rarely mention these reasons. Instead, they frequently claim that they are repurchasing shares because prevailing market prices 'undervalue' the stock and that it is a 'good investment'.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Despite this public endorsement, the average market response to the news of an open market share repurchase is only 3.5%. Such a small reaction seems inconsistent with the undervaluation theme voiced by managers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total undervaluation (announcement + drift) is ~15% for all firms and much higher for value firms. Book-to-market sorts show that true undervaluation, not other motives, drives the results — value stocks (most likely to be truly undervalued) show massive abnormal returns while glamour stocks show none.</p>
<p>The paper concludes that &quot;the full impact of corporate announcements can extend over several years&quot; and raises &quot;serious concerns about the appropriateness of measuring abnormal performance over short windows.&quot;</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Value Stocks = High Earnings Yield = Most EPS-Accretive Repurchases</h3>
<p>The paper's central finding — that repurchase abnormal returns are concentrated in value (high B/M) stocks — maps directly onto the EPS paradigm. High B/M stocks typically have high earnings yields (low P/E). In the EPS framework, repurchases are most accretive when the earnings yield is high: retiring a share at a high earnings yield boosts EPS by more per dollar spent. The 45.3% 4-year abnormal return for value repurchasers may reflect the market slowly recognizing the EPS accretion effect — high-EY firms buying back shares at bargain prices (relative to their earnings power).</p>
<h3>2. Glamour Stocks Show No Benefit — As the EPS Paradigm Predicts</h3>
<p>Glamour (low B/M) stocks have low earnings yields. In the EPS paradigm, repurchases for low-EY firms are less EPS-accretive or even EPS-dilutive if financed by expensive debt. The finding of zero abnormal returns for glamour repurchasers is consistent: repurchases don't boost EPS enough to matter when the earnings yield is low.</p>
<h3>3. Managers Say &quot;Undervaluation&quot; — But This Is EPS Language</h3>
<p>When managers say the stock is &quot;undervalued&quot; and repurchasing is a &quot;good investment,&quot; they are making an EPS calculation: the earnings yield on the stock exceeds their alternative cost of capital. In the EPS paradigm, &quot;undervalued&quot; means &quot;the earnings yield is high relative to what we'd earn on the cash.&quot; The 3.54% announcement return suggests the market recognizes some of this EPS accretion immediately, but the 45.3% 4-year abnormal for value stocks suggests the market is slow to fully price in the cumulative EPS effect.</p>
<h3>4. The Book-to-Market Sort Is an Earnings Yield Sort</h3>
<p>Book-to-market (B/P) and earnings yield (E/P) are highly correlated — both are value metrics. Sorting on B/M is approximately sorting on E/P. The monotonic increase in post-repurchase abnormal returns across B/M quintiles (from -3.8% for glamour to +45.3% for value) is consistent with monotonically increasing EPS accretion as the earnings yield rises.</p>
<h3>5. &quot;Underreaction&quot; May Be Slow P/E Adjustment</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, P = EPS × P/E. When a firm repurchases shares, EPS rises immediately (fewer shares), but the P/E may not adjust instantly. The &quot;underreaction&quot; documented by Ikenberry et al. may reflect slow P/E reversion: the market initially applies the pre-repurchase P/E to the post-repurchase (higher) EPS, then gradually adjusts the P/E upward as it recognizes the firm's improved earnings trajectory. The 4-year drift is the time it takes for the full EPS accretion to be reflected in both EPS levels and P/E multiples.</p>
<h3>6. Short-Term CARs Don't Vary by B/M — But Long-Run Returns Do</h3>
<p>The announcement return is ~3.5% regardless of B/M quintile, but long-run returns vary enormously (0% to 45%). This is puzzling under signaling theory (all firms send the same signal) but natural under the EPS paradigm: the immediate market reaction reflects the common signal (&quot;we think we're cheap&quot;), but the long-run return reflects the actual EPS accretion, which depends on the earnings yield.</p>
<h3>7. Repeat Repurchasers Show Larger Effects</h3>
<p>High B/M firms with repeat repurchase announcements show 56.4% 3-year abnormal returns — the largest effect in the paper. In the EPS paradigm, repeat repurchasers are firms that systematically buy back shares at high earnings yields. Each repurchase boosts EPS; repeated repurchases compound the effect. The market's persistent underreaction suggests it underestimates the cumulative impact of sustained EPS accretion programs.</p>
<h3>8. The Evidence Supports the EPS Paradigm's Timing Prediction</h3>
<p>The EPS paradigm predicts that firms should repurchase when the earnings yield is high (price is low relative to earnings) and issue equity when the earnings yield is low (price is high relative to earnings). Ikenberry et al.'s finding that value stocks (high E/P) benefit most from repurchases is consistent. The companion literature (Loughran &amp; Ritter 1995) shows equity issuance occurs when prices are high (low E/P). Together, these findings confirm that managers time transactions to exploit the earnings yield — repurchasing when E/P is high, issuing when E/P is low.</p>

<li><strong>Lakonishok, Shleifer &amp; Vishny (1994)</strong> — &quot;Contrarian Investing, Extrapolation, and Risk.&quot; Show that value stocks outperform generally.

<li><strong>Loughran &amp; Ritter (1995)</strong> — &quot;The New Issues Puzzle.&quot; Document long-run underperformance following equity issuance.

<li><strong>Jensen (1986)</strong> — &quot;Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow.&quot; Jensen would explain repurchases as disgorging free cash flow. Ikenberry et al.'s value-stock finding is more consistent with undervaluation/EPS accretion than with FCF discipline.</li>
<li><strong>Constantinides &amp; Grundy (1989)</strong> — &quot;Optimal Investment with Stock Repurchase and Financing as Signals.&quot; Theory paper on optimal repurchase decisions with signaling. Ikenberry et al. cite this as background.</li>
<li><strong>Baker &amp; Wurgler (2002)</strong> — &quot;Market Timing and Capital Structure.&quot; Repurchases at high B/M and equity issuance at low B/M constitute market timing. Ikenberry et al. provide evidence that timing works — repurchases at low prices produce long-run gains.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Ikenberry et al.'s finding that repurchase abnormal returns are concentrated in high B/M (high earnings yield) stocks is strong evidence for the EPS paradigm's prediction that repurchases are most effective when the earnings yield is high. The 45.3% 4-year abnormal for value repurchasers vs. 0% for glamour repurchasers is the empirical signature of EPS-accretive repurchases.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The substitution from dividends to repurchases (Grullon &amp; Michaely 2002) is predicted to be strongest for value firms, where EPS accretion from repurchases is largest. Ikenberry et al.'s value-stock result is consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The repurchase boom documented by Grullon &amp; Michaely, combined with Ikenberry et al.'s evidence that repurchases work best for value stocks, implies that the debt-financed buyback strategy should be most profitable for high-EY firms — exactly the Meli paper's prediction for the macro-level transformation.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — The slow price adjustment after repurchases (4-year drift) is consistent with backward-looking asset pricing: the market prices stocks based on trailing EPS, so as repurchases gradually boost EPS over time, the price gradually adjusts. Forward-looking efficient markets would adjust immediately.</li>
