    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal's 2005 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper presents the most comprehensive direct evidence that managers treat earnings per share as the central objective of financial reporting. Surveying 401 CFOs and conducting 20 in-depth interviews, they find that: (1) earnings are overwhelmingly ranked as the #1 financial metric reported to outsiders (159/401 rank it first vs. 36 each for revenues and cash flows); (2) the two most important earnings benchmarks are the same quarter last year (85.1%) and analyst consensus EPS (73.5%); (3) 80% of CFOs would cut discretionary spending (R&amp;D, advertising, maintenance) to meet an earnings target; (4) 55.3% would delay starting a positive-NPV project; (5) in a hypothetical scenario where a project has a 16% IRR (vs. 12% cost of capital) but would cause the firm to miss analyst consensus by 10 cents, only 59% would take the project; (6) 96.9% prefer a smooth earnings path over a bumpy one (holding cash flows constant); and (7) 78% would sacrifice economic value for smoother earnings. These findings constitute the strongest available survey evidence for the EPS paradigm's claim that managers maximize EPS rather than NPV.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1-2: Introduction and Methodology (pp. 3-12)</h3>
<p><strong>Survey design:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>401 CFOs completed the survey (response rate ~10.4% from a sample of ~3,846 drawn from Duke CFO survey panel and <em>CFO Magazine</em> subscribers)</li>
<li>20 in-depth follow-up interviews with senior financial officers</li>
<li>Time frame: Fall 2003, post-Sarbanes-Oxley</li>
<li>Companies: ~67% public, ~33% private; ~53% large (revenue &gt;$1B); diverse industries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key methodological choices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed anonymity — critical for eliciting candid responses about earnings management</li>
<li>Survey asks about &quot;financial executives in general&quot; (not &quot;you personally&quot;) to reduce social desirability bias on sensitive questions</li>
<li>Interview responses treated as most revealing — CFOs spoke candidly behind anonymity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 3: The Importance of Earnings and Earnings Benchmarks (pp. 12-21)</h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Earnings are &quot;in a class by themselves&quot;</strong></p>
<p>When asked to rank the three most important metrics reported to outsiders:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Metric</th>
<th>Ranked #1</th>
<th>Ranked in top 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Earnings</strong></td>
<td><strong>159/401 (39.7%)</strong></td>
<td>~65%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Revenues</td>
<td>36/401 (9.0%)</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash flows from operations</td>
<td>36/401 (9.0%)</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pro forma earnings</td>
<td>19/401 (4.7%)</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One interviewee stated bluntly: &quot;Earnings are in a class by themselves&quot; and &quot;Cash flows are nowhere near as important as earnings.&quot; Another: &quot;Revenues are vanity, earnings are sanity.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Earnings benchmarks (Table 2, Fig. 3)</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Benchmark</th>
<th>Agree or strongly agree</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Same quarter last year</td>
<td><strong>85.1%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Analyst consensus EPS</td>
<td><strong>73.5%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reporting a profit (vs. loss)</td>
<td><strong>65.2%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Previous quarter EPS</td>
<td>54.2%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The analyst consensus benchmark is critical — it is the I/B/E/S consensus of next-quarter EPS that the market watches. The same-quarter-last-year benchmark reflects the standard year-over-year comparison.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Why meet or beat benchmarks? (Table 4, Fig. 5)</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Motivation</th>
<th>Agree or strongly agree</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Build credibility with capital market</td>
<td><strong>86.3%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maintain or increase stock price</td>
<td><strong>80.0%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Improve external reputation of management</td>
<td><strong>77.8%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Convey future growth prospects</td>
<td><strong>69.7%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reduce stock price volatility</td>
<td><strong>63.2%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meet bonuses</td>
<td><strong>29.0%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meet bond covenants</td>
<td><strong>14.3%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Stock price is the dominant motivation, not bonuses or bond covenants. Interviewees confirm: career concerns and stock price are intertwined — CFOs believe that missing earnings leads to stock price drops, which leads to career risk.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Consequences of failing to meet benchmarks (Table 5, Fig. 6)</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Consequence</th>
<th>Agree or strongly agree</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Creates uncertainty about future prospects</td>
<td><strong>80.7%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Seen as &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; / hidden problems</td>
<td><strong>60.1%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative effect of past miss persists</td>
<td>~60%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Media coverage amplifies negative reaction</td>
<td>~50%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The &quot;cockroach theory&quot;: if a firm misses by one penny, the market worries there are more problems hidden. One CFO: &quot;The market wants no surprises.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section 4: Actions to Meet Earnings Benchmarks (pp. 21-25)</h3>
<p><strong>4.1 Real actions vs. accounting choices</strong></p>
<p>The paper's most striking finding: managers strongly prefer REAL economic actions over accounting manipulation to meet earnings targets.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>% who would take it</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cut discretionary spending (R&amp;D, advertising, maintenance)</strong></td>
<td><strong>80.0%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Delay starting a new project</strong></td>
<td><strong>55.3%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Book revenues early / delay booking expenses</td>
<td>~30-40%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Draw down reserves</td>
<td>~20-30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provide positive incentives for customers to buy more this quarter</td>
<td>~40%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>4.2 The critical hypothetical — sacrificing positive NPV projects:</strong></p>
<p>CFOs were presented with a scenario: a project with 16% IRR (cost of capital = 12%) that would affect quarterly EPS differently depending on the scenario:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>% who take the project</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>EPS meets consensus (project has no EPS impact)</td>
<td>~80%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Project helps meet consensus</td>
<td>~90%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Project causes firm to miss consensus by 10 cents</td>
<td><strong>59.4%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Project causes firm to miss consensus by 50 cents</td>
<td><strong>52%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Over 40% of CFOs would reject a value-creating project to avoid missing the consensus estimate.</strong> This is direct evidence that EPS targets override NPV considerations.</p>
<p>15 out of 20 interviewed CFOs stated: &quot;every company should take real actions to hit earnings targets.&quot; One CFO: &quot;We will cut R&amp;D spending if we are close to the number.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Accounting discretion within GAAP:</strong></p>
<p>CFOs acknowledge using within-GAAP discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking reserves by accelerating expense recognition (drawing on them later)</li>
<li>Accelerating revenue recognition timing</li>
<li>Changing assumptions for litigation reserves and asset impairment</li>
</ul>
<p>But post-Enron, managers are MORE reluctant to use accounting methods and MORE willing to take real economic actions instead — a &quot;preference for real economic actions in place of accounting discretion.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Future reversals:</strong></p>
<p>CFOs acknowledge that earnings management today creates reversals tomorrow. Their response: in a growing firm, future earnings growth will offset the reversal. But if the firm's condition deteriorates, &quot;small earnings management decisions can cascade and lead to big write-offs or large negative surprises in later periods.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Earnings guidance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>80.7% of surveyed CFOs guide analysts' earnings estimates</li>
<li>&quot;Managing analysts' expectations&quot; mentioned in 11 of 20 interviews</li>
<li>CFOs guide to a number BELOW their internal projection to maximize chances of a positive surprise</li>
<li>Rule of thumb: &quot;under-promise and over-deliver&quot;</li>
<li>Many CFOs deplore the guidance culture but view it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;</li>
<li>Analysts are &quot;complicit&quot; — they let bellwether stocks beat estimates to avoid industry-wide negative reactions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 5: Smooth Earnings Paths (pp. 25-30)</h3>
<p><strong>5.1 Preference for smooth earnings (keeping cash flows constant):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>96.9%</strong> prefer smooth earnings over bumpy earnings, holding cash flows constant</li>
<li>This is an extraordinarily strong consensus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivations for smooth earnings (Table 8):</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Motivation</th>
<th>Agree or strongly agree</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Smooth earnings perceived as <strong>less risky</strong></td>
<td><strong>88.7%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smoother earnings make it <strong>easier for analysts to predict</strong></td>
<td><strong>79.7%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smooth earnings <strong>reassure stakeholders</strong> (customers, suppliers)</td>
<td><strong>66.2%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smooth earnings result in <strong>lower cost of equity and debt</strong></td>
<td><strong>57.1%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smooth earnings convey <strong>higher growth prospects</strong></td>
<td><strong>46.3%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smooth earnings <strong>achieve/preserve higher credit rating</strong></td>
<td><strong>42.2%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>NOT supported:</strong> Smooth earnings help communicate true economic performance (weak support), or that smoothing is driven by bonus payments (respondents significantly disagree).</p>
<p>One CFO: &quot;businesses are much more volatile than what their earnings numbers would suggest.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Sacrificing value for smooth earnings:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>78% of CFOs admit they would sacrifice a small, moderate, or large amount of economic value to achieve smoother earnings</strong> (Table 9, Fig. 8).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the single most important number in the paper. Combined with the 59% who would reject positive-NPV projects to meet consensus, it confirms that managers subordinate NPV to earnings objectives.</p>
<p>From interviews: &quot;the market hates uncertainty.&quot; Every CFO interviewed prefers smooth earnings, even holding cash flows constant. &quot;This preference is as obvious to them as saying 'good is better than bad.'&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Critical EPS paradigm evidence:</strong> CFOs fear that their P/E multiple would DROP if earnings became more volatile, even if underlying cash flows were unchanged. They argue investors demand a lower &quot;risk premium&quot; for smooth earnings.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Marginal investor and target audience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CFOs view <strong>institutional investors</strong> as the most important marginal price-setters</li>
<li><strong>Analysts</strong> affect short-term prices</li>
<li><strong>Individual investors</strong> are a &quot;distant third&quot;</li>
<li>Higher P/E firms view institutions as relatively MORE important</li>
<li>CFOs worry about missed earnings triggering institutional selling → bandwagon effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do &quot;sophisticated&quot; investors punish earnings misses? CFOs give three reasons: (1) young analysts lack historical perspective, (2) relative performance evaluation creates bandwagon selling, (3) algorithmic/hedge fund trading amplifies short-term reactions.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Voluntary Disclosure Decisions (pp. 30-37)</h3>
<p><strong>6.1 Motivations for voluntary disclosure:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Motivation</th>
<th>Agree or strongly agree</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Reputation for transparent reporting</td>
<td><strong>92.1%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reduce information risk → improve predictability</td>
<td><strong>80%+</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Correct gaps in mandatory disclosures</td>
<td><strong>73.6%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attract analyst coverage</td>
<td><strong>50.8%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Correct undervalued stock price</td>
<td><strong>48.4%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>&quot;P/E lift&quot;</strong> from transparent disclosure</td>
<td><strong>42%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reduce cost of capital</td>
<td><strong>39.3%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The &quot;P/E lift&quot; finding is notable: 42% of CFOs believe voluntary disclosure leads to a higher P/E multiple. Executives think of disclosure in P/E terms — not as reducing a theoretical discount rate, but as literally lifting the multiple.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 Constraints on disclosure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a disclosure precedent: 69.6% (biggest constraint)</li>
<li>Proprietary information: ~60%</li>
<li>Litigation costs: 46.4%</li>
<li>Political costs: weak support</li>
<li>Agency costs: managers reluctant to admit</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6.3 Bad news vs. good news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>52.9% show no preference for speed of release</li>
<li>76.8% release bad news faster to avoid lawsuits</li>
<li>Bad firms delay bad news; good firms release it faster</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 7: Summary and Conclusions (pp. 37-40)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Financial officers view earnings, not cash flows, as the most important metric reported to outsiders.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The most surprising finding in our study is that most earnings management is achieved via real actions as opposed to accounting manipulations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Managers candidly admit that they would take real economic actions such as delaying maintenance or advertising expenditure, and would even give up positive NPV projects, to meet short-term earnings benchmarks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors identify five &quot;rules of the game&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stock market values <strong>predictability</strong> of earnings</li>
<li>There is a widely held belief that <strong>every firm manages earnings</strong> — one firm's failure to manage will be punished</li>
<li>If a firm misses a benchmark, it signals <strong>hidden problems</strong></li>
<li>Managers try to maximize <strong>smoothness</strong> in earnings</li>
<li>Firms should voluntarily disclose to reduce <strong>information risk</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The concluding observation: &quot;In the end, many of our results are disturbing. The majority of CFOs admit to sacrificing long-term economic value to hit a target or to smooth short-term earnings.&quot;</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. This Is the Definitive Survey Evidence for the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal provide the strongest available direct evidence that managers maximize EPS. The paper's central findings — earnings ranked #1, 80% cut discretionary spending, 55% delay projects, 40%+ reject positive NPV to meet consensus, 78% sacrifice value for smoothness — are exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts. No other survey has this level of candor and this sample size.</p>
<h3>2. EPS Targets Override NPV: The Smoking Gun</h3>
<p>The hypothetical scenario where 40%+ of CFOs reject a project with a 16% IRR (4% above cost of capital) to meet consensus EPS is the closest thing to a &quot;smoking gun&quot; for EPS maximization. In the NPV paradigm, this is irrational destruction of shareholder value. In the EPS paradigm, it is rational behavior: the EPS miss would damage the stock price (through the P/E multiple), potentially costing more than the project's NPV.</p>
<h3>3. The P/E Multiple Is the Mechanism</h3>
<p>CFOs explicitly talk in P/E terms. They fear P/E drops from volatile earnings. They seek &quot;P/E lift&quot; from disclosure. They believe smooth earnings get a higher P/E multiple. This confirms that managers understand and operate within the P = EPS x P/E framework. They manage the EPS numerator (through real and accounting actions) and try to influence the P/E denominator (through disclosure, smoothing, and guidance).</p>
<h3>4. Real Actions &gt; Accounting: EPS Maximization Is Operational, Not Cosmetic</h3>
<p>The preference for real economic actions (cutting R&amp;D, delaying projects) over accounting discretion means EPS maximization is not just about manipulating the reported number. Managers actually change the firm's real operations to produce smoother, more predictable EPS. This is more consistent with the EPS paradigm (managers genuinely optimize around EPS as the objective function) than with a narrow &quot;earnings management&quot; story (managers game the accounting).</p>
<h3>5. Earnings Guidance Confirms the EPS-Analyst Feedback Loop</h3>
<p>The finding that 80.7% guide analysts, trying to &quot;under-promise and over-deliver,&quot; confirms the EPS paradigm's description of the manager-analyst relationship. Managers and analysts collaboratively produce a consensus EPS forecast; this forecast is the E(EPS) in P = E(EPS) x P/E. The entire financial reporting infrastructure is oriented around producing and meeting this number.</p>
<h3>6. Smooth Earnings Are Not About Communication — They're About the P/E</h3>
<p>The 96.9% preference for smooth earnings, combined with the rejection of the &quot;communicate true performance&quot; explanation, is critical. CFOs don't smooth earnings to inform investors — they smooth earnings because volatile earnings get a LOWER P/E MULTIPLE. In the EPS paradigm: P = EPS x P/E, and the P/E depends on earnings predictability (as Collins &amp; Kothari 1989 show through the persistence/ERC channel). Smoothing EPS is equivalent to maximizing the P/E multiple.</p>
<h3>7. The &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; ARE the EPS Paradigm's Operating Manual</h3>
<p>The five rules Graham et al. identify — predictability is valued, everyone manages, misses signal hidden problems, maximize smoothness, disclose to reduce risk — constitute a description of how the EPS paradigm works in practice. These are not &quot;biases&quot; or &quot;mistakes.&quot; They are the operational rules that rational managers follow in a world where P = EPS x P/E and the P/E is influenced by the predictability, smoothness, and level of EPS.</p>
<h3>8. Stock Price Motivation Dominates — Not Bonuses or Covenants</h3>
<p>The finding that stock price (86.3%) dominates bonuses (29.0%) and covenants (14.3%) as a motivation for meeting earnings targets is important. In the NPV paradigm, earnings management is typically explained through agency theory (bonus contracts) or debt contracts (covenants). Graham et al.'s evidence says the primary driver is the stock price itself — exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts. Managers maximize EPS because EPS drives the stock price through P = EPS x P/E.</p>
<h3>9. Private Firms Also Manage Earnings — Evidence Against Pure Stock-Market Stories</h3>
<p>The finding that private firms also prefer smooth earnings, manage through real actions, and would sacrifice value for smoothness challenges explanations that rely solely on public market pressures. In the EPS paradigm, earnings capitalization is the general method of valuing businesses — private or public. Private firms smooth earnings because their bank creditors and potential IPO buyers also price using earnings multiples.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — CFOs explicitly discuss the P/E multiple: they fear P/E drops from volatile earnings, they seek &quot;P/E lift&quot; from disclosure, and they smooth earnings to maintain a high P/E.

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — The finding that 55.3% would delay a new project and 40%+ would reject a positive-NPV project to meet EPS is direct evidence for the capital budgeting paper's thesis that EPS-maximizing managers distort investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Graham et al.'s &quot;rules of the game&quot; are the operating rules of the max-EPS paradigm.
