    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Miller &amp; Modigliani's 1961 <em>Journal of Business</em> paper proves that, under perfect capital markets, rational behavior, and perfect certainty, dividend policy has no effect on the current price of shares or on the total return to shareholders. The proof is elegant: when a firm pays a higher dividend while holding its investment policy fixed, it must raise more external capital (by issuing new shares), and the dilution to existing shareholders exactly offsets the extra dividend. The paper's deeper contribution is presenting four formally equivalent valuation approaches — discounted cash flow, current earnings plus investment opportunities, stream of dividends, and stream of earnings — and showing they are different representations of the same underlying model. The constant growth specialization yields V(0) = X(0)(1-k)/(ρ - kρ*), which reduces to V(0) = X(0)/ρ when there are no growth opportunities (ρ* = ρ). The paper explicitly critiques the &quot;stream of earnings&quot; approach as prone to misinterpretation, coins the concept of &quot;informational content&quot; of dividends, introduces the &quot;clientele effect,&quot; and extends irrelevance to uncertainty via &quot;symmetric market rationality.&quot; For the EPS project, this is the second MM pillar (after MM 1958): it establishes dividend irrelevance and, in doing so, explicitly grapples with the earnings-based valuation approach that the EPS paradigm revives.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section I: Effect of Dividend Policy with Perfect Markets, Rational Behavior, and Perfect Certainty (pp. 411-415)</h3>
<p><strong>Three assumptions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Perfect capital markets&quot; — no buyer/seller large enough to affect prices, equal and costless access to information, no transaction costs, no tax differentials between dividends and capital gains</li>
<li>&quot;Rational behavior&quot; — investors prefer more wealth to less, are indifferent between dividends and capital gains of equal value</li>
<li>&quot;Perfect certainty&quot; — complete assurance about future investment programs and future profits</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The fundamental principle of valuation (Eq. 1):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[d_j(t) + p_j(t+1) - p_j(t)] / p_j(t) = ρ(t), independent of j</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rate of return (dividends + capital gains, divided by price) is the same for all shares in each period.</p>
<p>Equivalently (Eq. 2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_j(t) = 1/(1+ρ) × [d_j(t) + p_j(t+1)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restating in terms of the total value of the enterprise (Eq. 3):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(t) = 1/(1+ρ) × [D(t) + V(t+1) - m(t+1)p(t+1)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where D(t) is total dividends, V(t+1) is next period's total value, and m(t+1)p(t+1) is the value of newly issued shares.</p>
<p><strong>The irrelevance proof (Eq. 5):</strong></p>
<p>The amount of new capital raised externally must be (Eq. 4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>m(t+1)p(t+1) = I(t) - [X(t) - D(t)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substituting into (3):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(t) = 1/(1+ρ) × [X(t) - I(t) + V(t+1)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since D(t) does not appear in this expression, and since X(t), I(t), ρ(t), and V(t+1) are all independent of D(t) by assumption, <strong>the current value of the firm is independent of the current dividend decision.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Once you think of it, it is, after all, merely one more instance of the general principle that there are no 'financial illusions' in a rational and perfect economic environment. Values there are determined solely by 'real' considerations — in this case the earning power of the firm's assets and its investment policy — and not by how the fruits of the earning power are 'packaged' for distribution.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section II: What Does the Market &quot;Really&quot; Capitalize? (pp. 415-420)</h3>
<p>MM derive four equivalent valuation formulas, each starting from the fundamental Eq. (5):</p>
<p><strong>Approach 1 — Discounted cash flow (Eq. 9):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(0) = Σ_{t=0}^{∞} [X(t) - I(t)] / (1+ρ)^{t+1}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the textbook DCF formula: the value of the firm equals the present value of net cash flows (earnings minus investment).</p>
<p><strong>Approach 2 — Current earnings plus investment opportunities (Eq. 12):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(0) = X(0)/ρ + Σ_{t=0}^{∞} I(t) × [(ρ*(t) - ρ)/ρ] × (1+ρ)^{-(t+1)}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first term, X(0)/ρ, is the capitalized value of current earnings — exactly the EPS paradigm's pricing equation. The second term is the NPV of all future growth opportunities. <em><em>If ρ</em> = ρ (no abnormal growth), the second term vanishes and V = X(0)/ρ — the value IS simply capitalized current earnings.</em>*</p>
<p>MM comment on this formula (p. 417): &quot;a corporation does not become a 'growth' stock with a high price-earnings ratio merely because its assets and earnings are growing over time. To enter the glamor category, it is also necessary that ρ*(t) &gt; ρ.&quot; The essence of growth is earning above-normal returns, not merely expanding.</p>
<p><strong>Approach 3 — Stream of dividends (Eq. 13-14):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>p(t) = Σ_{τ=0}^{∞} d(t+τ) / (1+ρ)^{τ+1}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The standard dividend discount model. MM note this has &quot;been by far the most popular one in the literature of valuation&quot; and is &quot;entirely valid&quot; but &quot;not the only valid approach.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Approach 4 — Stream of earnings (Eq. 18-20):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(0) = Σ_{t=0}^{∞} [X(t) - ρI(t)] / (1+ρ)^{t+1}</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is the earnings approach — and MM explicitly validate it</strong> (p. 420):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Contrary to widely held views, it is also possible to develop a meaningful and consistent approach to valuation in terms of the stream of earnings generated by the corporation rather than the dividend distributions actually made to the shareholders.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they immediately warn against the &quot;straw man&quot; version — defining value as simply the discounted sum of future total earnings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In fairness, we should point out that there is no one, to our knowledge, who has seriously advanced this view.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also note that others have taken the &quot;supposed earnings counter-view to the dividend approach&quot; as &quot;simply the proposition that price is proportional to current earnings, i.e., V(0) = X(0)/ρ.&quot; MM say this IS valid when ρ* = ρ, but not in general.</p>
<h3>Section III: Earnings, Dividends, and Growth Rates (pp. 421-426)</h3>
<p><strong>The constant growth model (Eq. 23):</strong></p>
<p>When investment opportunities earn a constant ρ* in perpetuity and the firm invests a fraction k of earnings each period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(0) = X(0)(1-k) / (ρ - kρ*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, equivalently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V(0) = X(0)/ρ × [1 + k(ρ* - ρ)/(ρ - kρ*)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If ρ* = ρ: V(0) = X(0)/ρ — capitalized current earnings, regardless of retention k</li>
<li>If ρ* &gt; ρ: V(0) &gt; X(0)/ρ — the &quot;growth stock&quot; with P/E &gt; 1/ρ</li>
<li>If ρ* &lt; ρ: V(0) &lt; X(0)/ρ — the &quot;value trap&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Growth rate of dividends per share (Eq. 25):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>g = kρ* × (1-k_r)/(1-k) - k_e × ρ/(1-k)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where k_r is the fraction of profits retained, k_e is external capital raised as a fraction of profits. The dividend growth rate depends on the retention ratio, the return on investment, and the degree of external financing.</p>
<p><strong>The special case of purely internal financing:</strong> If all investment comes from retained earnings (k = k_r, k_e = 0), then g = kρ* and V(0) = X(0)(1-k)/(ρ - kρ*). In this case — and ONLY this case — dividend policy and investment policy are indistinguishable, creating the illusion of an &quot;optimal dividend policy.&quot;</p>
<p>MM caution (p. 424): &quot;The popularity of the internal financing model will be found to reflect little more than its ease of manipulation combined with the failure to push the analysis far enough to disclose how treacherous a case it really is.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Corporate earnings and investor returns (Eq. 26-27):</strong></p>
<p>The total return to shareholders is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D_t(t) + G_t(t) = X(t) × [ρ(1-k) / (ρ - kρ*)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where G_t is capital gains. When ρ* = ρ, the investor's return exactly equals corporate profits. When ρ* &gt; ρ (growth), the investor's return exceeds corporate earnings because growth opportunities produce capital gains beyond retained earnings.</p>
<h3>Section IV: Effects of Dividend Policy Under Uncertainty (pp. 426-430)</h3>
<p>MM extend dividend irrelevance to uncertainty by introducing two concepts:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Imputed rationality&quot;</strong> — an individual trader &quot;imputes rationality to the market&quot; if, in forming expectations, he assumes every other trader is rational.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Symmetric market rationality&quot;</strong> — the market as a whole satisfies this if every trader both is rational and imputes rationality to all others. This rules out &quot;speculative bubbles&quot; where an investor buys an overpriced security expecting to resell before the bubble bursts.</p>
<p><strong>The irrelevance proof under uncertainty (pp. 428-429):</strong>
Consider two firms with identical future earnings streams X̃(t) and investment streams Ĩ(t) but different current dividends. By symmetric market rationality, investors know that any difference in current dividends must be offset by an opposite difference in dilution from new share issuance. Therefore Ṽ₁(1) = Ṽ₂(1), and hence R̃₁(0) = R̃₂(0), so V₁(0) = V₂(0).</p>
<p><strong>Dividend policy and leverage (p. 429-430):</strong> The proof extends when V is interpreted as total market value (equity + debt). The accounting identity broadens to include interest on debt, and the conclusion remains: value is independent of dividend policy given investment policy.</p>
<p><strong>The informational content of dividends (p. 430):</strong>
MM coin this important concept to resolve the apparent contradiction between irrelevance and the observed phenomenon that dividend changes are followed by price changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Where a firm has adopted a policy of dividend stabilization with a long-established and generally appreciated 'target payout ratio,' investors are likely to (and have good reason to) interpret a change in the dividend rate as a change in management's views of future profit prospects for the firm.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dividend CHANGE provides information about EARNINGS; it is not the dividend LEVEL that affects value. This is &quot;informational content&quot; — dividends signal, they don't cause.</p>
<h3>Section V: Dividend Policy and Market Imperfections (pp. 431-433)</h3>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> Capital gains are taxed at lower rates than dividends → systematic preference for low-payout firms. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;clientele effect&quot; — each firm attracts investors suited to its payout ratio</li>
<li>Tax-exempt institutions hold a substantial fraction of shares</li>
<li>&quot;Except for taxable individuals in the very top brackets, the required difference in before-tax yields to produce equal after-tax yields is not particularly striking&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The &quot;only&quot; systematic imperfection (p. 432):</strong> If the tax advantage of capital gains is the major market imperfection, then low-payout stocks should sell at a PREMIUM. If they instead sell at a DISCOUNT (as the conventional view holds), &quot;there would be only one way to account for it; namely, as the result of systematic irrationality on the part of the investing public.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Footnote 34 on p. 432:</strong> MM suggest the alternative explanation is &quot;less plausibly, that there is a systematic tendency for external funds to be used more productively than internal funds.&quot; This foreshadows Jensen's (1986) free cash flow theory.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. V(0) = X(0)/ρ Is the EPS Paradigm's Pricing Equation</h3>
<p>MM's Eq. 12 decomposes firm value into X(0)/ρ (capitalized current earnings) plus the NPV of growth opportunities. When ρ* = ρ, the growth term vanishes and V = X(0)/ρ — exactly P = EPS × P/E with P/E = 1/ρ. MM treat this as a &quot;special case&quot;; the EPS paradigm treats it as the GENERAL case that practitioners actually use. The disagreement is empirical: how large is the growth opportunities term in practice, and does the market actually compute it?</p>
<h3>2. The Four Equivalent Valuation Approaches All Include an Earnings Approach</h3>
<p>MM explicitly validate the earnings approach (Approach 4, Eq. 18-20) as &quot;meaningful and consistent.&quot; They warn against the straw man of &quot;simply discounting total earnings&quot; — but they acknowledge that V = X(0)/ρ is correct when there are no abnormal growth opportunities. The EPS paradigm's claim is not the straw man that MM demolish, but the valid special case that MM themselves derive.</p>
<h3>3. Dividend Irrelevance Is Compatible with the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>MM show that dividends don't affect value. The EPS paradigm doesn't claim that dividends affect value — it claims that managers prefer REPURCHASES over dividends because repurchases boost EPS (by reducing share count) while dividends do not. The EPS paradigm's payout predictions are fully consistent with MM's irrelevance proposition: payout form matters for EPS, even though total payout is irrelevant for value.</p>
<h3>4. The Growth Model Explains Cross-Sectional P/E Variation</h3>
<p>V(0) = X(0)(1-k)/(ρ-kρ*) shows that the P/E ratio depends on the retention ratio (k), the return on investment (ρ*), and the market capitalization rate (ρ). In the EPS paradigm, P/E is determined by comps — but the COMPS THEMSELVES reflect these same fundamentals. High-growth industries have high P/E comps because their constituent firms have high ρ*. The EPS paradigm and MM agree on what determines P/E cross-sectionally; they disagree on whether individual investors explicitly compute it or take it from comps.</p>
<h3>5. &quot;Informational Content&quot; Supports Earnings-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>MM's concept of &quot;informational content&quot; is that dividend changes signal EARNINGS changes. The market reacts to dividends because dividends carry information about earnings, not because dividends have value in themselves. This is exactly the EPS paradigm's view: the market prices EARNINGS. Dividends are relevant only as signals about the earnings trajectory. The informational content concept implicitly concedes that earnings are what the market &quot;really&quot; capitalizes.</p>
<h3>6. The Internal Financing Special Case Creates the Illusion of Optimal Dividends</h3>
<p>MM show that when all financing is internal, dividend policy and investment policy are indistinguishable, creating the illusion of an optimal dividend policy. They warn this case has been &quot;treacherous&quot; for researchers who mistake it for the general case. In the EPS paradigm, the internal financing case IS approximately the general case: most firms finance primarily from internal funds (Donaldson 1961, Myers 1984), so dividend policy IS de facto investment policy. The &quot;treacherous&quot; special case may be the empirically relevant one.</p>
<h3>7. The Clientele Effect Supports EPS-Based Payout Choice</h3>
<p>MM's clientele effect — each firm attracts investors suited to its payout ratio — has an EPS analog: each firm attracts investors who value its EPS growth trajectory. Firms that maximize EPS through repurchases attract &quot;growth&quot; investors; firms that pay dividends attract &quot;income&quot; investors. The clientele self-selects based on the EPS characteristics of the firm.</p>
<h3>8. MM Dismiss the Observed Dividend Premium as &quot;Irrationality&quot;</h3>
<p>If low-payout stocks sell at a discount despite tax advantages, MM say the only explanation is &quot;systematic irrationality.&quot; The EPS paradigm offers a different explanation: high-payout (high dividend) firms may have higher P/E ratios because the market values the STABILITY implied by steady dividends — dividends signal earnings persistence, and persistent earnings command higher multiples (Collins &amp; Kothari 1989).</p>
<h3>9. The Paper Establishes the Analytical Framework for All Payout Research</h3>
<p>Like MM (1958) for capital structure, MM (1961) is the starting point for all subsequent payout research: signaling theories (Bhattacharya 1979), agency theories (Easterbrook 1984, Jensen 1986), clientele theories (Allen, Bernardo &amp; Welch 2000), catering theories (Baker &amp; Wurgler 2004). Each adds a friction to explain why dividends might matter. The EPS paradigm explains payout choices without frictions: managers choose the payout form (repurchases &gt; dividends) that maximizes EPS.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — &quot;The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment.&quot; MM (1961) is the dividend companion to MM (1958) on capital structure. Together they establish irrelevance of both capital structure and dividend policy.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — &quot;Distribution of Incomes of Corporations Among Dividends, Retained Earnings, and Taxes.&quot; MM cite Lintner for evidence on dividend stabilization and &quot;target payout ratios.&quot; The informational content discussion directly builds on Lintner's observation that managers smooth dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon (1959, 1962)</strong> — &quot;Dividends, Earnings, and Stock Prices&quot; and <em>The Investment, Financing, and Valuation of the Corporation</em>. Gordon argued for the &quot;bird-in-the-hand&quot; view that dividends are less risky than capital gains, making low-payout stocks riskier. MM explicitly critique this as the &quot;bird-in-the-hand fallacy&quot; (footnote 18, p. 424).</li>
<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — <em>The Theory of Investment Value</em>. The present value of dividends approach (Approach 3). MM note it is &quot;entirely valid&quot; but not the only valid approach.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1957)</strong> — &quot;Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox.&quot; MM cite Durand on the &quot;growth stock paradox&quot; — the seeming possibility that a growth stock could have infinite value.</li>
<li><strong>Walter (1956)</strong> — &quot;Dividend Policies and Common Stock Prices.&quot; MM cite Walter as advancing a valuation formula in which dividend policy directly affects price — a position MM refute.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1951)</strong> — <em>Security Analysis</em>, 3rd ed. Cited in MM's references for the traditional view on dividends and earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Grullon &amp; Michaely (2002)</strong> — Document the substitution from dividends to repurchases. MM's irrelevance proposition says payout FORM shouldn't matter — but Grullon &amp; Michaely show firms systematically prefer repurchases, consistent with EPS maximization.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (2001)</strong> — &quot;Disappearing Dividends.&quot; Document the decline in dividend-paying firms. In MM's framework, the shift away from dividends is irrelevant. In the EPS paradigm, it reflects the rise of EPS-maximizing behavior (repurchases boost EPS; dividends do not).</li>
<li><strong>Black (1976)</strong> — &quot;The Dividend Puzzle.&quot; Black echoed MM's irrelevance but acknowledged it as a &quot;puzzle&quot; that dividends persist despite tax disadvantages.</li>
<li><strong>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo (2006)</strong> — &quot;The Irrelevance of the MM Dividend Irrelevance Theorem.&quot; Argue that MM's proof requires 100% FCF payout, making the retention/payout choice trivially irrelevant. The real question is optimal payout vs. retention.</li>
<li><strong>Collins &amp; Kothari (1989)</strong> — Show that earnings persistence increases the earnings response coefficient (and hence P/E). Steady dividends may signal earnings persistence.</li>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — The pecking order (internal funds first, then debt, then equity) is consistent with MM's internal financing special case where dividend and investment policy are indistinguishable.</li>
<li><strong>Shiller (1981)</strong> — &quot;Do Stock Prices Move Too Much.&quot; Challenges the present value of dividends model (MM's Approach 3) by showing prices are far too volatile. The EPS paradigm's response: prices reflect EPS × P/E, not PV(dividends).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — MM (1961) is the theoretical foundation for dividend irrelevance, which the EPS paradigm does NOT contradict. Instead, the EPS paradigm explains payout FORM choice: managers prefer repurchases because they boost EPS. The EPS paradigm operates within MM irrelevance while explaining patterns MM cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The payout paper should cite MM (1961) as the starting point. Four equivalent valuation formulas → the earnings approach is valid → managers optimize payout form for EPS without violating MM irrelevance. The constant growth model V(0) = X(0)/ρ when ρ* = ρ is the paper's pricing equation.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — MM (1961) is the second major blow to the pre-MM tradition. After MM (1958) eliminated the case for optimal capital structure, MM (1961) eliminated the case for optimal dividend policy. Together, they left corporate finance with &quot;nothing to do&quot; — all corporate financial policy became irrelevant. The post-MM research program has been adding frictions back to make policy matter again. The EPS paradigm instead restores policy relevance by changing the objective function.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — MM's Eq. 12 decomposes value into X(0)/ρ (backward-looking earnings capitalization) plus growth opportunities (forward-looking). The EPS paradigm argues the market primarily uses the first term; the NPV paradigm argues the second term is also important.</li>
