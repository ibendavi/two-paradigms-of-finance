    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Grullon &amp; Michaely's 2002 <em>Journal of Finance</em> paper provides comprehensive evidence that firms have been systematically substituting share repurchases for dividends. Using Compustat data from 1972-2000 (134,646 firm-year observations), they document that while dividend payout ratios declined from ~50% to ~27% of earnings, repurchase ratios rose from 4.8% to 41.8%, keeping total payout roughly constant. The substitution is not just an aggregate trend — it operates at the firm level: firms that repurchase more have larger negative deviations from the Lintner (1956) dividend model, meaning they pay LESS in dividends than their earnings would predict. The market recognizes this substitution: firms that repurchase experience significantly smaller stock price drops when they cut dividends (CAR of −0.45% vs. −1.93% for non-repurchasers). A pivotal institutional finding is that SEC Rule 10b-18, adopted in 1982, provided safe harbor protections for repurchases and was followed by a ~1,000% increase in repurchase activity. For the EPS project, this paper is essential because share repurchases are the primary mechanism through which EPS-maximizing managers boost EPS — retiring shares when the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax borrowing cost — and Grullon &amp; Michaely document the massive secular shift toward this tool.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Substitution Hypothesis (Section I, pp. 1649-1654)</h3>
<p>The &quot;substitution hypothesis&quot; predicts that repurchases are replacing dividends as the preferred payout method. This contrasts with the &quot;complementary hypothesis,&quot; which would have both payout forms increasing together.</p>
<p><strong>Why might firms prefer repurchases?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Tax advantage: repurchases generate capital gains (taxed at lower rates or deferred) rather than ordinary income</li>
<li>Flexibility: repurchases don't create expectations of continuation (unlike dividends, which are &quot;sticky&quot;)</li>
<li>EPS management: repurchases reduce share count, directly boosting EPS</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Regulatory context:</strong> Before SEC Rule 10b-18 (November 1982), firms faced significant legal risk from open-market repurchases — potential charges of stock manipulation under Securities Exchange Act §9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5. Rule 10b-18 provided safe harbor conditions (volume limits, timing restrictions, single broker, price conditions) that dramatically reduced this risk.</p>
<h3>Section II: Data (pp. 1654-1657)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Source: Compustat 1972-2000 (active and research files)</li>
<li>134,646 firm-year observations</li>
<li>Repurchases measured as increase in treasury stock (Compustat item 226) when positive; alternative: cash used for purchases of common and preferred stock (item 115)</li>
<li>Dividends: common dividends (item 21)</li>
<li>Key ratios: DIV/EARN, REPO/EARN, TOTAL/EARN (total payout to earnings)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The critical finding:</strong> Total payout (DIV + REPO) has been remarkably STABLE at roughly 50-70% of earnings, even as the MIX shifted dramatically from dividends to repurchases. By 2000, repurchases EXCEEDED dividends (REPO/DIV = 155.7% for industrial firms).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The visual shows the total payout ratio approximately flat, with the dividend component declining and the repurchase component rising to fill the gap — classic substitution.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Distribution of firms by payout method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Dividends only&quot; firms declined from ~70% to ~20% of all firms</li>
<li>&quot;Repurchases only&quot; firms grew substantially</li>
<li>&quot;Both dividends and repurchases&quot; firms also grew</li>
<li>&quot;Neither&quot; remained relatively stable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figure 3: New initiations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Among firms initiating a cash distribution for the first time, the fraction choosing repurchases-only rose from &lt;27% (early 1980s) to &gt;84% (late 1990s)</li>
<li>NEW firms overwhelmingly choose repurchases over dividends</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table II: Firm characteristics by payout type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dividend payers are larger, older, more profitable, and have less volatile earnings</li>
<li>Repurchase-only firms are smaller, younger, and more volatile</li>
<li>This is consistent with Fama &amp; French (2001): the &quot;disappearing dividends&quot; reflect changes in firm characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table IV: Transition probabilities:</strong>
Firms are increasingly &quot;sticky&quot; in their repurchase behavior — once a firm starts repurchasing, it tends to continue. The probability of repurchasing again conditional on having repurchased last year increased from ~55% (1970s) to ~75% (1990s).</p>
<h3>Section IV: Firm-Level Substitution — The Lintner Test (pp. 1665-1672)</h3>
<p>The key innovation: using the Lintner (1956) partial adjustment model to test firm-level substitution. If firms substitute repurchases for dividends, then firms that repurchase more should UNDERSHOOT their Lintner-predicted dividend levels.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Estimate Lintner model: D_{t+1} = a₀ + a₁D_t + a₂E_{t+1}</li>
<li>Compute forecast errors: ERROR = Actual D_{t+1} - Predicted D_{t+1}</li>
<li>Sort firms by repurchase yield (RYIELD = repurchases/market cap)</li>
<li>Test whether ERROR is more negative for high-RYIELD firms</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Table V: Forecast errors by repurchase yield quintile</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>RYIELD quintile</th>
<th>Mean ERROR</th>

<tr>

<td>−0.108%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High RYIELD</td>
<td>−0.144% to −0.326%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>The pattern is strikingly monotonic:</strong> firms that repurchase more have increasingly negative dividend forecast errors. High repurchasers pay 14-33 basis points LESS in dividends than the Lintner model predicts.</p>
<p><strong>Table VI: Cross-sectional regressions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR_{i,t+1} = b₀ + b₁RYIELD_{i,t} + controls + ε</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RYIELD coefficient: −0.01312 to −0.01766 (significant at 1% level), with controls for size, profitability, growth, industry, year. The effect is economically meaningful and survives all controls.</p>
<h3>Section V: Market Perception of Substitution (pp. 1672-1676)</h3>
<p>If the market understands that repurchases substitute for dividends, then dividend CUTS should be less bad news for repurchasing firms (because the market knows the cut reflects substitution, not bad prospects).</p>

<p>Firms that repurchase experience a <strong>75% smaller price drop</strong> when they cut dividends. The market recognizes the substitution.</p>
<p><strong>Table VIII: Multivariate regressions</strong> confirm this after controlling for size of dividend cut, firm size, profitability, and leverage. The DUMREPO coefficient (dummy for repurchasing firms) is +1.1423% (t = 2.78) — repurchasing firms experience 1.14 percentage points less negative reaction to dividend cuts.</p>
<h3>Section VI: Rule 10b-18 and the Regulatory Catalyst (pp. 1676-1680)</h3>
<p><strong>Historical context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before 1982: open-market repurchases exposed firms to potential manipulation charges</li>
<li>November 1982: SEC adopted Rule 10b-18, providing safe harbor conditions:
<ul>
<li>Single broker per day</li>
<li>No opening or closing transactions</li>
<li>Price not exceeding highest independent bid</li>
<li>Volume ≤ 25% of average daily volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rule 10b-18 did NOT legalize repurchases (they were already legal) — it provided PROTECTION against manipulation charges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table XI: Pre- vs. post-Rule 10b-18 repurchase levels</strong></p>
<p>All measures of repurchase activity increased dramatically after 1982:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean REPO/EARN: increased ~1,000% (from negligible to substantial)</li>
<li>Mean RYIELD: similarly massive increase</li>
<li>The shift is statistically and economically overwhelming</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table IX: Tax Reform Act of 1986 and repurchase announcement CARs</strong></p>
<p>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the capital gains rate from 20% to 28%, shrinking the tax advantage of repurchases relative to dividends. Consistent with the tax motive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-TRA 1986 repurchase announcement CAR: +3.49%</li>
<li>Post-TRA 1986 repurchase announcement CAR: +2.42%</li>
<li>Difference: −1.07% (significant)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the tax advantage shrank, the market reacted less positively to repurchase announcements.</p>
<p><strong>Table X:</strong> The TAX differential variable (dividend tax rate minus capital gains rate) is positively related to repurchase announcement CARs — wider tax wedge → more positive market reaction to repurchases.</p>
<h3>Section VII: Conclusions (pp. 1680-1682)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our results strongly support the hypothesis that firms finance their share repurchase programs with funds that would otherwise be used to increase dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Perhaps most important, our results show that Rule 10b-18 may have been the single most important event in the history of corporate payout policy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Repurchases Are the EPS-Maximizing Payout Tool</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, the choice between dividends and repurchases is simple: repurchases boost EPS by reducing share count, while dividends do not. Grullon &amp; Michaely document the massive secular shift toward repurchases — exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts. As managers became increasingly focused on EPS (post-1980s), they shifted toward the payout mechanism that directly boosts EPS.</p>
<h3>2. The Substitution Is Driven by the Same Logic as EPS Maximization</h3>
<p>Grullon &amp; Michaely frame the substitution as tax-driven (capital gains vs. ordinary income). The EPS paradigm offers a simpler explanation: repurchases boost EPS, dividends do not. A $1 repurchase at an earnings yield of 8% permanently boosts EPS by $0.08 per retired share; a $1 dividend has no effect on EPS. The shift from dividends to repurchases is a shift from an EPS-neutral to an EPS-accretive payout form.</p>
<h3>3. Rule 10b-18 Enabled EPS-Maximizing Behavior</h3>
<p>The finding that Rule 10b-18 was followed by a ~1,000% increase in repurchases is critical for the EPS paradigm's historical narrative. Before 1982, managers who wanted to boost EPS through repurchases faced legal risk. After 1982, the safe harbor removed this barrier. The timing coincides almost exactly with the rise of &quot;EPS culture&quot; — analyst focus on quarterly EPS, option-based compensation tied to stock price, and the buyback boom that defines modern corporate finance.</p>
<h3>4. Stable Total Payout Supports the EPS Paradigm's Earnings-Based View</h3>
<p>The remarkable stability of total payout (DIV + REPO ≈ 50-70% of earnings throughout 1972-2000) supports the EPS paradigm's view that payout is fundamentally about distributing earnings. The LEVEL of payout hasn't changed — only the FORM. This is consistent with managers targeting a payout ratio of earnings (as in Lintner 1956) while shifting the mix toward the form that maximizes EPS.</p>
<h3>5. The Lintner Model Confirmation Supports Earnings-Based Payout</h3>
<p>Grullon &amp; Michaely use the Lintner model as their benchmark — dividends are a function of EARNINGS, with partial adjustment. The forecast errors from this earnings-based model are explained by repurchase intensity. This confirms that the underlying framework for payout is earnings-based: managers start with an earnings-determined dividend target and then reallocate some of that target to repurchases to boost EPS.</p>
<h3>6. Market Recognizes Substitution — The EPS Signal</h3>
<p>The finding that dividend cuts are less penalized for repurchasing firms (CAR −0.45% vs. −1.93%) has EPS implications. In the EPS paradigm, the market cares about EPS, not dividends per se. If a firm cuts dividends but uses the saved cash for repurchases, EPS goes UP (fewer shares). The market penalizes the dividend cut less because EPS is maintained or improved. The market is pricing the EPS trajectory, not the dividend trajectory.</p>
<h3>7. New Firms Choose Repurchases — Generational Shift in EPS Culture</h3>
<p>The finding that &gt;84% of new payout initiators choose repurchases (up from &lt;27%) reflects a generational shift in corporate culture toward EPS maximization. New firms, managed by a generation raised on EPS targets and option compensation, naturally choose the EPS-boosting payout form. They are not &quot;deciding&quot; between dividends and repurchases based on tax optimization — they are choosing the tool that directly serves their EPS objective.</p>
<h3>8. Timing Aligns with the EPS-Financial Markets Nexus</h3>
<p>The repurchase boom documented by Grullon &amp; Michaely (concentrated in the 1990s-2000s) coincides exactly with the period analyzed in the Ben-David, Chinco, Meli paper on EPS maximization and financial markets. The falling interest rates of the 1990s-2000s made debt-financed buybacks increasingly EPS-accretive, amplifying the substitution trend.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — Grullon &amp; Michaely's substitution evidence is the primary motivation: the EPS-maximizing payout paper explains WHY firms choose repurchases over dividends (EPS accretion) and WHEN they do so (when earnings yield exceeds after-tax borrowing cost).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The timing of the repurchase boom (1990s-2000s) coincides with falling rates making debt-financed buybacks increasingly EPS-accretive.
