  <div class="key-finding-box">
    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Fisher's 1907 book establishes the present-value principle as the UNIVERSAL method for valuing ANY asset — stocks, bonds, land, mines, businesses — from their expected income streams. He explicitly states &quot;capital-value is discounted income&quot; and that stocks carry an implicit interest rate just like bonds. He also develops the NPV rule for investment selection and what later became known as Fisher Separation. This is the book that should have transformed equity valuation — but the Lyon (1917) curriculum shows it had NO visible influence on practice for at least a decade.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Central Reversal of Causation (p. 13)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is not because the orchard is worth $20,000 that the annual crop will be worth $1000, but it is because the annual crop is worth $1000 that the orchard will be worth $20,000.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Capital-value derives from income, not the reverse.</strong> This reverses the naive direction and establishes the intellectual foundation for all DCF valuation.</p>
<h3>Universal Application to ALL Assets (p. 10-11)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not bonds and notes alone, but all securities, imply in their price and their expected returns a rate of interest. There is thus an implicit rate of interest in stocks as well as in bonds.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also applies to: land (&quot;years' purchase&quot;), machinery, mines, orchards, forests, buildings, human capital.</p>
<h3>The NPV Rule (Ch. VIII, p. 140)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The choice among the options will simply depend on the one which gives the maximum present value, reckoned at the market rate of interest.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerical example: Land used for forestry ($8,820 PV at 5%), mining ($9,110 PV), or farming ($9,000 PV). Choose mining. But at different rates, the ranking changes.</p>
<h3>Fisher Separation (Ch. VIII)</h3>
<p>Two-step optimization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the investment with highest present value (production decision)</li>
<li>Borrow or lend to achieve desired consumption pattern (financing decision)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the intellectual ancestor of Modigliani-Miller.</p>
<h3>The Fisher Equation (Ch. V)</h3>
<p><strong>(1 + i') = (1 + i)(1 + a)</strong> where i' = nominal rate, i = real rate, a = inflation rate</p>
<h3>Time-Preference as Foundation</h3>
<p>Interest rate = index of society's preference for present over future income. Determined by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-shape of income streams (ascending/descending/uniform)</li>
<li>Personal characteristics (foresight, self-control, life expectancy, regard for heirs)</li>
<li>Investment opportunities (Second Approximation)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Fisher Did NOT Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Did not develop a specific stock valuation formula (that would be Williams 1938)</li>
<li>Did not discuss dividends vs. earnings as the basis for equity value</li>
<li>Did not address risk formally (Third Approximation is sketchy)</li>
<li>Did not influence practitioners for decades (as Lyon 1917 proves)</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <ol>
<li><strong>The theoretical foundation for ALL of modern finance</strong>: DCF, NPV, WACC, M&amp;M all trace back to Fisher</li>
<li><strong>Bridges economics and finance</strong>: Before Fisher, &quot;interest&quot; was an economics topic; after Fisher, it became the backbone of finance</li>
<li><strong>The present-value gap explained</strong>: Fisher published this in 1907, but Lyon (1917) shows zero practitioner adoption. The academic-practitioner gap was enormous.</li>
<li><strong>Academic stream, pure</strong>: Written as economic theory, not as an investment guide</li>
</ol>

        <p><strong>The Consensus Era</strong> (1720–1957)</p>
        <p>For over 200 years, practitioners and scholars alike valued assets by capitalizing earnings at market-observed yields.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Built on:</strong> Bohm-Bawerk (1889) <em>Capital and Interest</em> — which Fisher critiques extensively</li>
<li><strong>Companion:</strong> Fisher (1906) <em>The Nature of Capital and Income</em> — definitions</li>
<li><strong>Revised as:</strong> Fisher (1930) <em>The Theory of Interest</em> — expanded and revised edition</li>
<li><strong>Led directly to:</strong> Williams (1938) who applied Fisher's framework specifically to stock valuation</li>
<li><strong>Ignored by:</strong> Lyon (1917) curriculum — no trace of Fisher's influence on practice</li>
<li><strong>Eventually formalized by:</strong> Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958), who cited Fisher</li>
