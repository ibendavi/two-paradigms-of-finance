    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Lintner's 1965 <em>Review of Economics and Statistics</em> paper is his independent derivation of what will become known as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed concurrently with Sharpe (1964) and Mossin (1966). Working with dollar returns rather than rates of return, Lintner derives the equilibrium theorem that the ratio of expected excess aggregate dollar returns to aggregate risk is proportional for each company, with γ = λ/T being the &quot;market price of dollar risk&quot; — the same for ALL companies in the market. The key valuation equation is V₀ᵢ = (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/r*, where Wᵢ is the aggregate risk adjustment (certainty-equivalent deduction). Section V derives the capital budgeting implications: the accept/reject criterion for projects under uncertainty depends on five factors — the risk-free rate, the market price of risk, the project's own variance, its covariance with existing assets, and its covariance with concurrent projects. Most remarkably, Lintner shows that &quot;sufficiently risk-reducing investments rationally belong in corporate capital budgets even at the expense of lowering expected present value returns&quot; and that &quot;there can be no single 'risk discount rate'&quot; for evaluating individual projects — conclusions that directly challenge the use of a single cost of capital (whether CAPM-derived or earnings-yield-based).</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Sections I-II: The Individual Investor's Portfolio Problem (pp. 13-18)</h3>
<p>Lintner sets up the portfolio problem for a risk-averse investor who can hold a safe asset (at rate r*) and a set of risky stocks. Let:</p>
<ul>
<li>ȳ = expected rate of return on any asset mixture</li>
<li>σ_y = standard deviation of return</li>
<li>A₀ = total net investment</li>
<li>θ = fraction of wealth in the optimal stock mix</li>
</ul>
<p>The investor maximizes expected utility E[U(A₀ȳ, A₀σ_y)] = Ū(A₀ȳ, A₀σ_y), subject to the investment opportunities characterized by the set of all stock mixes, each represented by a pair of values (ȳ, σ_y). The first-order conditions yield:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>θ = (ȳ - r*)/σ_y = maximized risk-adjusted excess return (the tangent from r* to the efficient frontier)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Separation Theorem (p. 16):</strong> &quot;The composition of the best portfolio of common stocks for any investor is independent of the scale of the total investment made in these stocks.&quot; The optimal stock mix depends only on expected returns, variances, and covariances — not on the investor's risk preferences or wealth. Risk preferences determine only how much to invest in the risky portfolio vs. the safe asset.</p>
<h3>Section III: Market Equilibrium — The Central Theorem (pp. 20-27)</h3>
<p>Lintner derives the equilibrium conditions when all investors optimize simultaneously. Define:</p>
<ul>
<li>V₀ᵢ = aggregate market value of the i^th stock at time zero</li>
<li>R̄ᵢ = expected aggregate dollar return on the i^th stock (dividends + capital appreciation)</li>
<li>R̂ᵢⱼ = covariance of aggregate dollar returns between stocks i and j</li>
<li>T ≡ Σᵢ V₀ᵢ = total market value of all stocks</li>
<li>λ = aggregate risk parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>The equilibrium conditions (equation 12a) give:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(R̄ᵢ - r*V₀ᵢ)/V₀ᵢ = λ(V₀ᵢ/T)(R̂ᵢᵢ/(V₀ᵢ)²) + λΣⱼ≠ᵢ(V₀ⱼ/T)(R̂ᵢⱼ/(V₀ᵢV₀ⱼ))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which reduces to the fundamental pricing equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>R̄ᵢ - r*V₀ᵢ = (λ/T) Σⱼ R̂ᵢⱼ</strong> (equation 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (p. 26):</strong> &quot;Under Idealized Uncertainty, equilibrium in purely competitive markets of risk-averse investors will have adjusted themselves so that the ratio of the expected excess aggregate dollar returns of each stock to the aggregate dollar risk of holding the stock will be the same for all stocks (and equal to λ/T), when the risk of each stock is measured by the variance of its own dollar return and its combined covariance with that of all other stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>This implies γᵢ = γⱼ = λ/T — a COMMON VALUE for all companies in the market.</p>
<h3>The Valuation Equation (pp. 26-27)</h3>
<p>From equation (27), solving for V₀ᵢ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>V₀ᵢ = (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/r</strong>* (equation 29)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where Wᵢ = γᵢ Σⱼ R̂ᵢⱼ = aggregate risk deduction (certainty-equivalent adjustment).</p>
<p>Three key corollaries:</p>
<p><strong>Corollary I:</strong> Market values are related to standard deviations of dollar returns and covariances, NOT directly and NOT linearly.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary II:</strong> The aggregate risk (Σⱼ R̂ᵢⱼ) directly relevant to V₀ᵢ is simply its CONTRIBUTION to the variance of dollar returns for all holders together of ALL stocks (i.e., Σᵢ Σⱼ R̂ᵢⱼ).</p>
<p><strong>Corollary III:</strong> The RATIO (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/R̄ᵢ of the i^th stock is the certainty-equivalent of aggregate dollar returns to their expected value, different for each i^th company. The analysis &quot;justifies viewing market values as riskless-rate present values of certainty-equivalents of random future receipts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Key rewriting (equation 29'):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V₀ᵢ = (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/r* = (V₀ᵢ + R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/(1 + r*) = (H̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/(1 + r*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where H̄ᵢ = expected end-of-period aggregate value. This shows that &quot;the current aggregate value of any equity is equal to the certainty-equivalent of the sum of its prospective cash receipts (to shareholders) and total market value at the end of the first period, discounted at the riskless rate r*.&quot;</p>
<h3>The &quot;Risk Discount Rate&quot; for Individual Companies (pp. 27-28)</h3>
<p>Lintner derives the appropriate &quot;risk discount rate&quot; for each company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>k_ri = r*(1 - γΣⱼR̂ᵢⱼ/R̄ᵢ)⁻¹ (equation 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>k_ri = r</em>(1 - γΣⱼR̂ᵢⱼ/R̄ᵢ)⁻¹</em>* (equation 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is apparent that (i) the appropriate 'risk' discount rate is unique to each individual company in a competitive equilibrium (because of the first half of Corollary III above); (ii) that efforts to derive it complicate rather than simplify the analysis, since (iii) it is a derived rather than a primary variable; and that (iv) it explicitly involves all the elements required for the determination of V₀ᵢ itself.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a devastating result for the single-cost-of-capital approach: the discount rate is endogenous, company-specific, and depends on ALL the same information needed to compute value directly.</p>
<h3>Section V: Corporate Capital Budgeting Under Uncertainty (pp. 28-33)</h3>
<p>This is the paper's most important section for the EPS project. Lintner derives the NPV rule under uncertainty from the equilibrium conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The capital budgeting criterion (equation 32):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ΔR̄ᵢ - γΔR̂ᵢᵢ = ΔH̄ᵢ - γΔH̃ᵢᵢ &gt; 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A project should be accepted if and only if its change in expected dollar return exceeds the market-price-of-risk-weighted change in aggregate risk.</p>
<p><strong>For a single project j added to existing assets (equation 34a):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ΔR̄ᵢ - γΔR̂ᵢᵢ = H̃ⱼ^(1) - r*H_j^(0) - γ[H̃ⱼⱼ + 2H̃ⱼ₀ + 2X̃ⱼ₀]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where H̃ⱼ^(1) = expected end-of-period present value, H_j^(0) = initial cost, and the terms in brackets represent the project's own variance plus its covariances with existing assets and with other new projects.</p>
<p><strong>The key equation for project evaluation (equation 37):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>η_j* = H̃_j*^(1) - r<em>H_j</em>^(0) - γ[H̃_j<em>j</em> + 2Σ_{k*≠j*≠0} a_k H̃_j<em>k</em> + 2H̃_j*0] &gt; 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where η_j* is the &quot;net gain&quot; to the company and its shareholders of accepting the project.</p>
<p><strong>Five factors determining the minimum expected return (p. 31):</strong></p>
<p>The minimum expected return (in dollars of expected end-of-period present value H̃_j*^(1)) required to justify allocation of funds to a given risky project costing H_j*^(0) is an increasing function of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(i) r</strong>* — the risk-free rate of return</li>
<li><strong>(ii) γ</strong> — the &quot;market price of dollar risk&quot;</li>
<li><strong>(iii) H̃_j<em>j</em></strong> — the project's own present-value variance</li>
<li><em><em>(iv) Σ_{k</em>≠j</em>≠0} H̃_j<em>k</em>** — the project's covariance with existing company assets and other concurrent projects already accepted</li>
<li><em><em>(v) Σ_{k</em>≠j</em>≠0} a_k H̃_j<em>k</em>** — the project's total covariance with other projects concurrently included in the capital budget</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Devastating Conclusion: No Single Risk Discount Rate (pp. 31-32)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sufficiently risk-reducing investments rationally belong in corporate capital budgets even at the expense of lowering expected present value returns&quot; (p. 31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means negative-NPV projects (using any single discount rate) may be rational if they reduce portfolio risk sufficiently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it necessarily follows that there can be no single 'risk discount rate' to use in computing present values (or as a 'hurdle rate' which the 'expected return' must exceed) or as a discount rate in obtaining present values of net cash inflows and outflows... for the purpose of deciding on the acceptance or rejection of different individual projects out of a subset of projects even if all projects in the subset have the same degree of 'risk.'&quot; (p. 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the CAPM's capital budgeting implication taken to its logical conclusion: the &quot;cost of capital&quot; is project-specific and depends on the entire capital budget. There is no shortcut.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the prevalent use of a single 'risk-discount rate' or a 'company-risk-class' 'cost-of-capital' for project selection in capital budgets is a dangerous expedient which is positively misleading as generally employed in the literature.&quot; (p. 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section VI: Relaxed Assumptions (pp. 33-35)</h3>
<p>Lintner briefly considers what happens when the simplifying assumptions are relaxed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> If investors cannot borrow unlimited amounts at r*, the Separation Theorem may fail, and the optimal portfolio mix depends on the utility function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing rate r</strong> &gt; lending rate r*:** If r** &gt; r* but max θ using r* implies w &lt; 1 (no borrowing needed), the theorem holds. If max θ using r** implies w &gt; 1 (borrowing needed), the optimal mix and optimal financing must be determined simultaneously using the utility function explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing rate increases with leverage (w-1):</strong> The theorem holds under condition (2a), but if w &gt; 1, the optimal mix and financing must be determined simultaneously. &quot;If the borrowing rate is not independent of the stock mix, the optimal mix and the optimal financing must be determined simultaneously using the utility function explicitly.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. No Single &quot;Cost of Capital&quot; — The CAPM Proves Too Much</h3>
<p>Lintner's most devastating result for the EPS project is his demonstration that &quot;there can be no single 'risk discount rate'&quot; for capital budgeting. If taken seriously, the CAPM implies that EVERY project needs its own risk-adjusted rate, determined by its covariances with all existing assets and all concurrent projects. This makes the NPV rule practically impossible to implement as Lintner himself acknowledges — it's a &quot;programming solution&quot; requiring the variance-covariance matrix of all projects.</p>
<h3>2. The Practitioner Shortcut: Use the Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>If the theoretically correct approach (project-specific risk-adjusted discount rates from the full covariance structure) is impractical, practitioners need a shortcut. The EPS paradigm provides one: use the earnings yield as the cost of equity for ALL projects. This is the &quot;dangerous expedient&quot; Lintner warns against — but it has the virtue of simplicity and is exactly what Graham &amp; Harvey (2001) document: 59% of firms use a single company-wide discount rate.</p>
<h3>3. &quot;Sufficiently Risk-Reducing Investments&quot; — EPS vs. NPV</h3>
<p>Lintner's finding that risk-reducing projects may be accepted &quot;even at the expense of lowering expected present value returns&quot; shows that the NPV rule (accept all positive-NPV projects) is NOT the correct rule under uncertainty when projects have correlated risks. The EPS rule (accept projects that are EPS-accretive) ignores this risk dimension entirely — but so does the single-cost-of-capital NPV rule that most textbooks teach.</p>
<h3>4. The Equilibrium Validates V₀ᵢ = (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/r* — Certainty-Equivalent Pricing</h3>
<p>Lintner's valuation equation V₀ᵢ = (R̄ᵢ - Wᵢ)/r* shows that in equilibrium, stock values equal certainty-equivalent returns discounted at the riskless rate. The earnings capitalization formula P = E/k is a simplified version of this: if E is the certainty-equivalent of earnings (i.e., expected earnings minus a risk adjustment) and k includes the risk premium, then E/k ≈ (R̄ - W)/r*. The two approaches converge.</p>
<h3>5. Company-Specific Discount Rates Undermine Single-k Approaches</h3>
<p>Lintner shows that k_ri is unique to each company (equation 30). This means both the CAPM-based cost of capital AND the earnings yield are approximations — the true required return depends on the company's specific covariance structure with the market. The question is which approximation practitioners actually use, and the evidence (Graham &amp; Harvey 2001, the EPS paradigm) overwhelmingly points to earnings-based measures.</p>
<h3>6. The Gap Between Theory and Practice</h3>
<p>Lintner's theoretically rigorous capital budgeting framework requires knowledge of the full variance-covariance matrix of all projects and all existing assets. No firm has ever implemented this. The gap between theory (CAPM-based project evaluation) and practice (single hurdle rates, payback periods, EPS accretion tests) is not a failure of practice — it reflects the impossibility of implementing the theory as Lintner derives it.</p>

<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — Lintner explicitly validates MM Propositions I and II under his idealized uncertainty conditions (p. 28). But he shows the capital budgeting implications are far more complex than MM's simple cost-of-capital rule.</li>
<li><strong>Lutz &amp; Lutz (1951)</strong> — Cited as [13] for the certainty case of capital budgeting. Lintner shows his capital budgeting criterion under uncertainty &quot;reduces to Lutz' rule under certainty — since with certainty the right-hand ratio term is zero.&quot;</li>

<li><strong>Gordon &amp; Shapiro (1956)</strong> — Gordon &amp; Shapiro's earnings-yield-based capital budgeting rule is exactly the &quot;dangerous expedient&quot; that Lintner warns against. But it is also the rule practitioners actually use.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean's capital budgeting framework (which Gordon &amp; Shapiro and Lintner are both extending) uses the earnings yield as the cost of equity — the simple rule that Lintner's theory shows is theoretically inadequate but practically necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — Myers's &quot;Capital Structure Puzzle&quot; will show that firms don't use the sophisticated risk-adjusted rates Lintner derives. They use simple rules — which the EPS paradigm describes.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Harvey (2001)</strong> — Graham &amp; Harvey document that 59% of firms use a single company-wide discount rate and 57% use payback. Lintner's 1965 paper shows this is theoretically wrong. The EPS paradigm explains why firms do it anyway: they use the earnings yield as a simple, observable cost of equity.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — Lintner's paper derives the theoretically correct but practically impossible capital budgeting rule. The EPS paradigm's rule (invest if return &gt; earnings yield, i.e., if EPS-accretive) is the practitioner shortcut that Lintner would call a &quot;dangerous expedient&quot; but that firms universally employ.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Lintner's demonstration that k_ri is company-specific (equation 30) and that no single discount rate works for capital budgeting (p. 32) paradoxically supports the EPS paradigm: since the theoretically correct approach is impractical, firms fall back on the observable earnings yield as their cost of equity.</li>
