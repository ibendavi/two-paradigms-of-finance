    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Dewing's five-volume <em>Financial Policy of Corporations</em> (1920), written at Harvard, represents the dominant American corporate finance textbook of the pre-theoretical era. It contains an EXPLICIT earnings capitalization formula for valuation: &quot;the price promoters are willing to pay is ten times the net earnings&quot; (Vol. II, p. 73), and public utility commissions value properties at &quot;about twelve times its net earnings&quot; (p. 75). The book also articulates the fundamental axioms of capital structure as functions of earnings stability, establishes that &quot;the determining factor is past and present earning power&quot; (not asset cost), and frames dividends as a problem of earnings distribution. The framework is entirely earnings-based and comparables-driven -- no DCF, no present value, no Fisher -- confirming that earnings capitalization was the standard valuation method in elite American finance education in 1920.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>&quot;Finance is the Science of Money&quot; (Introduction, Vol. I, p. vii)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Finance is the science of money. As the value of money lies in the value of other things for which it is exchanged, any transaction in which goods or services are given for money, might be called a financial operation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This opening line reveals the field's self-conception in 1920: finance = money management, not asset valuation or capital allocation in the modern sense.</p>
<h3>Theory and Practice Unified (Preface, Vol. I, p. vi)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have a strong belief that there is no opposition between the theory and the practice of sound finance. As in all other spheres of social activity, good practice is based on sound theory and sound theory has its constant pragmatic justification in successful practice.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is remarkable because it comes at a moment when &quot;theory&quot; meant institutional description and case-based reasoning, NOT mathematical models. There was no academic-practitioner gap because there was no distinct academic theory.</p>
<h3>Corporation Finance = Descriptive Enterprise (Introduction, Vol. I, pp. viii-ix)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The primary purpose of the present work is to describe the financial processes of corporations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Corporation finance deals with both fact and policy. It is concerned with fact, in so far as it describes the prevailing customs and methods which are employed in the financial administration of the modern corporation; it deals with policy, in so far as it succeeds in formulating principles or rules of expediency which may serve as guides to sound financial procedure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction between &quot;fact&quot; (what companies actually do) and &quot;policy&quot; (what they should do) is Dewing's entire methodological framework. There is no third category of &quot;theory&quot; in the mathematical sense.</p>
<h3>Earning Power as the Basis for Capitalization (Vol. II, pp. 41-44)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Except, then, in fixing the amount of money that must be raised at the time of promotion, the cost of the property acquired or to be acquired by the new corporation should exercise no influence on the financial plan. The determining factor is past and present earning power.&quot; (p. 44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the key passage. Dewing explicitly rejects asset cost as the basis for valuation and replaces it with earning power. But &quot;earning power&quot; is discussed qualitatively, not as a formula. There is no V = E/r, no capitalization rate, no multiplier.</p>
<h3>No Connection Between Cost and Income (Vol. II, pp. 41-43)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Especially important is it that the bankers should recognize that there is no necessary connection between cost and income.&quot; (p. 41)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our competitive system of production knows no 'ought' in the relation between property investment and earnings. It justifies earnings solely on the basis of economic service as evidenced by the demands of society.&quot; (p. 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This insight — that asset cost does not determine income — is economically sophisticated. It implicitly rejects book-value-based valuation. But Dewing does not take the next step of deriving a present-value formula.</p>
<h3>CRITICAL: Explicit Earnings Capitalization Formula (Vol. II, Ch. V, pp. 73-75)</h3>
<p>The most important valuation content in all five volumes appears in Chapter V, &quot;The Financial Plan of the New Public Utility.&quot; Dewing provides the EXPLICIT earnings capitalization formula with specific multiples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;one may say that roughly the price promoters are willing to pay is ten times the net earnings&quot; (p. 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is V = 10 x E, i.e., a 10% capitalization rate (or P/E = 10x), stated as established practice in 1920.</p>
<p>He also provides a second, lower capitalization rate based on regulatory proceedings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;commissions have usually reached the conclusion that six to eight per centum was a reasonable return on the amount of investment. Ordinarily the operating expenses absorb 60 per cent of the gross earnings, so that the remaining 40 per cent, representing the net earnings, would represent about 8 per cent of the commission's valuation. This is the same as saying that commissions would assume that a public utility property should earn about one-twelfth of its value each year, or, conversely it would be worth about twelve times its net earnings.&quot; (p. 75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives BOTH the cap rate (8%) AND the multiple (12x) explicitly, derived from regulatory practice. The Investment Bankers Association report confirmed 6-8% as the standard fair return.</p>
<p>Crucially, Dewing emphasizes that valuation is earnings-based, not asset-based:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Their price is not a matter of physical valuation, but of earnings and 'possibilities,' as the future opportunities for development are called.&quot; (pp. 73-74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is yield-based pricing using comparables -- exactly the EPS paradigm. No discounted cash flow, no present value. Just current net earnings times a market-determined multiple.</p>
<h3>Central New York Gas and Electric Company (Vol. II, p. 72)</h3>
<p>Dewing provides a detailed table showing the earnings of the Central New York Gas and Electric Company before and after consolidation, illustrating how promoters assessed acquisition targets based on earnings capacity.</p>
<h3>Three Methods for Estimating Future Earnings (Vol. II, Ch. IV, pp. 48-55)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invested capital as a basis</strong> (p. 48) — Earnings of comparable businesses relative to their capital investment. Only valid for commoditized industries with free entry.</li>
<li><strong>Earnings of similar businesses</strong> (p. 49) — &quot;a better test of the future earning capacity... is the earnings of other concerns engaged in the same business.&quot; But warns: &quot;No two enterprises ever yield the same profit, even though all conditions are identical except that of management.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Dead reckoning&quot; from probable demand</strong> (p. 50) — Estimating earnings from projected sales volumes. Dewing is skeptical: &quot;how much the whole subject is a matter of surmise.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Failure of Consolidation Earnings (Vol. II, p. 53)</h3>
<p>Dewing provides a table of &quot;Earnings Before and After Consolidation&quot; for nine industrial combinations, showing that post-merger earnings averaged only <strong>65%</strong> of pre-consolidation earnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States Leather Company: 0% of prior earnings</li>
<li>National Salt Company: 134% (an outlier)</li>
<li>United States Realty: 50%</li>
<li>American Bicycle Company: 34%</li>
<li>American Malting Company: 31%</li>
<li>New England Cotton Yarn Company: 98%</li>
</ul>
<p>This is early empirical evidence of the &quot;merger destroys value&quot; phenomenon that would become a major finding in modern M&amp;A research.</p>
<h3>Earnings Variability by Industry (Vol. II, pp. 53-55)</h3>
<p>Dewing distinguishes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stable earnings</strong>: National Biscuit (consumer staples under established trademarks) — &quot;Baker's Chocolate and Karo Corn Syrup are so widely known that the volume of sales in any one year can be predicted with remarkable accuracy&quot; (p. 54)</li>
<li><strong>Volatile earnings</strong>: manufacturers of costly or specialized machinery; companies in cyclical industries</li>
<li>General principle: &quot;the past earnings for a period of years often furnish a more valuable basis of prediction than the earnings of a single year&quot; (p. 55) — anticipating Graham's emphasis on average earnings over a cycle</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Securities Hierarchy (Vol. II, p. 40)</h3>
<p>Dewing articulates the fundamental axioms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(1) bonds should be issued only when the future earnings of the corporation are liberal and reasonably constant; (2) preferred stock may be issued when the earnings are irregular but, when averaged over a period of years, give a fair margin over the preferred stock dividend requirements; (3) common stock and only common stock should be issued when the earnings of the new corporation are uncertain and unpredictable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the earnings-coverage framework for capital structure — the precursor to modern coverage ratios and credit analysis.</p>
<h3>Volume I: Descriptive Securities Taxonomy</h3>
<p>Vol. I (Corporate Securities) is a 154-page encyclopedia of security types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonds: mortgage, collateral trust, consolidated, guaranteed, assumed, income, debenture, participating, convertible</li>
<li>Preferred stocks: dividend rates, cumulative vs. non-cumulative, participating, voting rights, redemption provisions</li>
<li>Common stock: only briefly mentioned (pp. 7, 13)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type is described through detailed case studies of specific companies (mostly railroads and industrial trusts). There is NO discussion of stock valuation, no P/E ratio, no yield analysis. Securities are described as legal instruments, not as priced financial assets.</p>
<h3>The Cost of Borrowed Capital (Vol. III, Ch. III, pp. 29-41)</h3>
<p>Volume III addresses &quot;The Administration of Income.&quot; Chapter III on &quot;The Cost of Borrowed Capital&quot; establishes that interest on borrowed capital is the FIRST charge against net profits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Interest on borrowed capital is therefore the first charge against net profits.&quot; (p. 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dewing classifies five forms of payment for borrowed capital: cash discounts, interest on merchandise loans, interest on funded debt, rentals and royalties, and bond discount amortization. The key insight is that all borrowing costs must be deducted from earnings before the stockholders' residual can be computed -- the same sequential logic that underlies EPS maximization (debt service comes first, equity holders get the residual).</p>
<h3>The Principles Governing the Distribution of Profits to Stockholders (Vol. III, Ch. VI, pp. 72-100)</h3>
<p>Chapter VI is devoted entirely to dividend policy, and its framing is deeply relevant to the EPS paradigm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The dividend disbursement is essentially a problem of business expediency and can be treated only in this light.&quot; (p. 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the fundamental question of dividend policy is that of the proportions of annual earnings that shall be distributed and that shall be retained.&quot; (p. 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the accounting methods of a corporation were perfect, and liberal reserves for all contingencies set aside... the only reason that would lead to the retention of any earnings in the business would be the belief that the money would earn more for the stockholders in the business than if it were distributed among them.&quot; (p. 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last passage is remarkable: Dewing articulates what amounts to a reinvestment test -- retain earnings only if the internal rate of return exceeds what stockholders could earn elsewhere. This is a proto-cost-of-equity concept, though stated qualitatively rather than formally.</p>
<p>Four practical considerations for dividend policy (pp. 76-82):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Amount justified for reinvestment</strong> -- depends on nature of business and ease of obtaining outside capital</li>
<li><strong>Confidence in accounting methods</strong> -- directors retain extra as buffer against earnings overestimation</li>
<li><strong>Regularity</strong> -- &quot;the strength of the feeling that a dividend rate once commenced should be adhered to&quot; (p. 77)</li>
<li><strong>Earning prediction difficulty</strong> -- regularity of dividends requires prediction of future earnings</li>
</ol>
<p>On dividend regularity (pp. 82-86):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The regularity of dividend payments helps the corporation in two very important respects. It creates a loyal group of stockholders who hold their stock for investment and not for speculation. It also creates a strong credit to be utilized for borrowing in the open market.&quot; (p. 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dewing provides a remarkable data table (p. 85) showing dividend histories of major corporations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pennsylvania Railroad: 63 consecutive years of dividends, average 6.3%</li>
<li>Illinois Central Railroad: 56 years, average 7.0%</li>
<li>Pullman Company: 45 years, average 8.7%</li>
<li>New England Telephone and Telegraph: 33 years, average 5.4%</li>
<li>Westinghouse Air Brake: 44 years, average 31.0%</li>
<li>Diamond Match Company: 30 years, average 9.1%</li>
</ul>
<p>The emphasis on regularity and the creation of &quot;investment&quot; (as opposed to &quot;speculative&quot;) stockholders anticipates Lintner's (1956) findings about dividend smoothing by decades.</p>
<h3>Earnings Prediction and Industry Type (Vol. III, pp. 83, 88-91)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Underlying all other considerations in the general question of dividend regularity, is the fact that the net earnings of a business corporation are never regular.&quot; (p. 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dewing distinguishes between businesses with stable earnings (consumer goods: &quot;matches and writing paper... are bought in essentially the same amounts in good times and in bad times,&quot; p. 90) and volatile earnings (producer goods: &quot;the manufacturer of locomotives will make few sales during the period of business depression,&quot; p. 90). This stability hierarchy maps directly to his capital structure axioms (Vol. II): stable earnings support bonds; volatile earnings support only common stock.</p>
<h3>What Dewing Did NOT Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>No reference to Irving Fisher (1907) or any economic theory of interest</li>
<li>No stock market analysis or investment advice</li>
<li>No concept of &quot;intrinsic value&quot; distinct from market price</li>
<li>No risk-based pricing model or CAPM-style framework</li>
<li>No DCF analysis for project evaluation or capital budgeting</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Explicit Earnings Capitalization in 1920</h3>
<p>Contrary to the earlier assessment that Dewing lacked quantitative valuation formulas, deeper reading reveals that Vol. II, Ch. V contains EXPLICIT earnings capitalization: &quot;ten times the net earnings&quot; (p. 73) and &quot;twelve times its net earnings&quot; (p. 75). This places quantitative earnings-based valuation at Harvard in 1920, earlier than Gerstenberg (1924). While the formula is presented as practitioner common knowledge (not derived from theory), it IS V = E x multiple, which is the core of the EPS paradigm.</p>
<h3>2. Earning Power Replaces Asset Cost</h3>
<p>Dewing's key intellectual contribution is establishing earning power as the basis for valuation, explicitly rejecting asset cost: &quot;there is no necessary connection between cost and income&quot; (p. 41). Valuation is &quot;not a matter of physical valuation, but of earnings and 'possibilities'&quot; (p. 73). This earnings-over-assets principle is the foundation of the capitalization approach.</p>
<h3>3. The Promotion Context</h3>
<p>Valuation in Dewing is always in the context of PROMOTION (creating a new corporation, consolidating existing businesses) — not in the context of stock market investing or security analysis. The question is &quot;how should we capitalize this new enterprise?&quot; not &quot;what is this stock worth?&quot; This is a fundamentally different framing from Graham &amp; Dodd (1934/1940).</p>
<h3>4. Early Evidence on M&amp;A Failure</h3>
<p>The table showing consolidation earnings averaging 65% of pre-merger levels is remarkably early empirical evidence that mergers destroy value — a finding that would be rediscovered in academic studies of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<h3>5. Fisher's Invisibility</h3>
<p>The complete absence of Fisher (1907) from Dewing's five volumes confirms the Lyon (1917) finding: Fisher's present-value revolution in economics had ZERO penetration into finance practice or education as of 1920. The academic-practitioner gap was so profound that it was invisible — practitioners did not even know what they were missing.</p>
<h3>6. Capital Structure as Earnings-Stability Function</h3>
<p>The three axioms of capital structure (bonds for stable earnings, preferred for moderate, common for uncertain) derive entirely from the earnings profile of the business -- not from tax shields, agency costs, or information asymmetry. This is the pre-MM framework in pure form: capital structure follows from the nature of the business's earnings, not from frictions.</p>
<h3>7. Dividend Policy as Earnings Distribution</h3>
<p>The Vol. III dividend chapters frame payout entirely as the distribution of earnings, with retention justified only when internal returns exceed external opportunities. The emphasis on dividend regularity (anticipating Lintner 1956 by 36 years) shows that smoothing was already standard practice and explicitly recommended.</p>
