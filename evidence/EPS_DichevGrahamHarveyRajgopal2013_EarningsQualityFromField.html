    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal's 2013 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper surveys 169 public and 206 private company CFOs (plus 12 in-depth interviews) about earnings quality. The central finding for the EPS project: CFOs overwhelmingly view earnings as a number whose primary purpose is VALUATION — 94.67% rate &quot;for use by investors in valuing the company&quot; as a very important use of earnings (average rating 4.72 out of 5), ranking first among all uses. CFOs view earnings as &quot;one number&quot; used for both external and internal purposes. High-quality earnings are defined as &quot;sustainable, repeatable, recurring&quot; (the #1 response in both public and private firms) and &quot;free from one-time items&quot; (#2). About 50% of earnings quality is determined by innate factors (business model, industry, macro conditions) rather than managerial discretion. On earnings management: CFOs estimate that roughly 20% of firms misrepresent economic performance in any given year, with the typical magnitude approximately 10% of reported EPS (9.85 cents per dollar of EPS). The top motivations for earnings management are: influencing stock price (93.5% agree), outside pressure to hit earnings benchmarks (92.9%), inside pressure to hit benchmarks (91.0%), and influencing executive compensation (88.6%). Reporting discretion has declined over the past 20 years, and CFOs view financial reporting as increasingly a compliance exercise. CFOs strongly prefer matching-based accounting (92.2%) and conservatism (75.4%) over fair value accounting. For the EPS project, this paper provides the CFO-side confirmation that earnings are understood primarily as a VALUATION input — the &quot;one number&quot; that determines what the company is worth — exactly as P = EPS x P/E predicts.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 1-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Despite enormous academic literature on earnings quality, there is little direct evidence from the practitioners who produce and use earnings. This paper surveys and interviews CFOs to understand how they think about earnings quality — its definition, determinants, and vulnerability to manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Three sets of findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The concept and characteristics of earnings quality</li>
<li>Standard setting and its impact on earnings quality</li>
<li>The prevalence and detection of earnings management</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section 2: Survey Design (pp. 3-5)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 558 total responses (5.4% response rate). 169 public firms, 206 private firms. Demographics: manufacturing dominant, MBA majority, ~49% corporate finance background. Also 12 in-depth CFO interviews and 2 standard setter interviews.</p>

<p>Valuation DOMINATES all other uses. CFOs see earnings as, first and foremost, a number that investors use to value the company.</p>
<p><strong>CFO interviews confirm:</strong> Earnings are viewed as &quot;one number&quot; for both external (investor) and internal (management) purposes. There is no distinction between earnings-for-valuation and earnings-for-contracting — it is the same number serving all purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Table 6 — Innate vs. discretionary:</strong> CFOs estimate that approximately 50% of earnings quality is determined by innate (non-discretionary) factors (mean 49.98%, median 50.00%). The other 50% is influenced by management choices and accounting standards.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Standard Setting (pp. 13-17)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 7 — Reporting discretion:</strong> CFOs feel that reporting discretion has DECLINED over the past 20 years (mean change = -4.22 on a scale). Current GAAP rules moderately constrain the ability to report high-quality earnings (mean = 35.57 on a 0-100 scale).</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>CFOs strongly prefer MATCHING and CONSERVATISM. Fair value accounting gets mixed to low support, especially for non-financial assets.</p>
<p><strong>Interview evidence:</strong> Multiple CFOs criticize fair value accounting: &quot;the balance sheet has become the big obsession, and a lot of that is because of the financial industries.&quot; They view fair value as creating &quot;volatility and change, even though nothing in the business seems to have changed.&quot;</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>CFOs want FEWER rules and more consistency. The desire for fewer rules contradicts the simultaneous desire for more implementation guidance — suggesting CFOs want clarity within a simpler framework.</p>
<h3>Section 5.5: Interview Insights (pp. 23-24)</h3>
<p><strong>Audit firm behavior:</strong> CFOs complain that FASB's rules-based approach reduces auditor judgment. &quot;The big audit firms are not passing authority downstream to the regional headquarters.&quot; Junior auditors lack training. &quot;The rules in the accounting firms come from high above now rather than from the field.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting as compliance:</strong> Several CFOs view financial reporting as a &quot;compliance activity&quot; — &quot;we just do what the regulators tell us to do rather than innovate via reporting practices for better access to capital.&quot; This suggests that reporting has shifted from an information-provision tool to a regulatory checkbox.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Misrepresenting Earnings (pp. 24-30)</h3>
<p><strong>6.1 How common is earnings management?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Table 10 — Prevalence:</strong> CFOs estimate that roughly 18.4% of firms (mean; 15% median) use discretion within GAAP to misrepresent economic performance in any given year. Moreover, 99.4% of CFOs agree that at least some firms manage earnings. Private firm CFOs estimate higher prevalence (30.4% vs. 18.4%).</p>
<p><strong>Table 11 — Magnitude:</strong> For firms that manage earnings, assuming $1 EPS, the typical misrepresentation is 9.85 cents (mean; 10 cents median). Thus ~10% of EPS is managed. Private firm CFOs estimate a larger magnitude (12.35 cents).</p>
<p><strong>Table 12 — Direction:</strong> 58.8% (mean; 67% median) of misrepresentation increases income. The rest decreases income. So roughly 60/40 income-increasing vs. income-decreasing.</p>

<p>The top motivations are ALL EPS-related: stock price (which depends on EPS), hitting earnings benchmarks (i.e., EPS targets), and compensation (which is tied to EPS — cf. Huang et al. 2014 showing 44.8% use EPS as bonus metric).</p>
<p><strong>Interview quote on EPS management:</strong> &quot;We were going to get a $1.50 EPS number and you could report anywhere from a $1.45 to a $1.55, and so you sit around and have the discussion saying well, do we want the number to be within that range?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Another CFO on compensation and EPS:</strong> &quot;Over the last five years, compensation consultants have shifted many companies toward using a GAAP-based earnings hurdle for their stock compensation. Due to IRC Section 162(m) considerations, they tie such stock compensation to a performance metric. I think earnings management is still done, and in many cases it is for executive compensation.&quot;</p>

<p>The #1 red flag — earnings diverging from cash flows — is the same signal academics have identified. CFOs and academics agree on the key diagnostic.</p>
<p><strong>6.4 Acquisition accounting as earnings management vehicle:</strong></p>
<p>Several CFOs specifically mention acquisition accounting: &quot;I have seen some CFOs taking advantage. I have seen numerous managements earn big incentives by being able to manage a balance sheet accrual. They are set up at the time of the acquisition... these accrual reversals did impact earnings and sometimes for a period of time, two-three years because they were big acquisitions.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4 Real earnings management:</strong> &quot;Earnings are often managed using real actions such as cutting R&amp;D, maintenance expenses and marketing expenditures&quot; — CFOs acknowledge this practice but note it is &quot;harder to detect but often more damaging&quot; than accrual management. This confirms Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal's (2005) finding that 80% would cut discretionary spending.</p>
<h3>Section 7: Conclusions (pp. 30-31)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Most respondents believe that high quality earnings are sustainable and are free from one-time items. They add that high quality earnings reflect consistent reporting choices, are backed by actual cash flows, and avoid unreliable long-term estimates.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;CFO views on earnings quality remain largely the same across public and private firms, for different uses of earnings, and over various manager and firm characteristics. The dominance of the sustainability notion of earnings quality, combined with CFO preference for 'one number' earnings for external and internal uses, suggests that earnings quality is a more homogenous and stable concept than previously thought.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Earnings Are Understood as a VALUATION Input — By the People Who Produce Them</h3>
<p>The finding that 94.67% of CFOs rate &quot;for use by investors in valuing the company&quot; as the most important use of earnings is direct evidence that CFOs understand the P = EPS x P/E model. They produce earnings primarily so investors can value the company — exactly as the EPS paradigm describes. This is the supply-side confirmation of investor-side pricing.</p>
<h3>2. &quot;One Number&quot; Confirms EPS as the Objective Function</h3>
<p>CFOs view earnings as a single number serving all purposes — valuation, contracting, compensation, management. This &quot;one number&quot; view is precisely the EPS paradigm's claim: EPS is not one of many metrics but THE metric that governs corporate behavior. The fact that CFOs don't distinguish between earnings-for-valuation and earnings-for-compensation confirms that EPS maximization is the unified objective.</p>
<h3>3. Sustainability = Earnings Capitalization</h3>
<p>The #1 definition of high-quality earnings — &quot;sustainable, repeatable, recurring&quot; — is exactly what makes earnings suitable for capitalization. In P = EPS x P/E, the EPS that matters is sustainable EPS. CFOs define earnings quality in terms that validate the capitalization model: good earnings are earnings you can capitalize.</p>
<h3>4. The Top Motivations for Earnings Management Are All EPS-Related</h3>
<p>Stock price (93.5%), benchmark pressure (92.9% outside, 91.0% inside), and compensation (88.6%) — ALL of these operate through EPS. The stock price depends on EPS (via P = EPS x P/E). The benchmarks ARE EPS targets. The compensation is tied to EPS (Huang et al. 2014). Every motivation points to EPS maximization.</p>
<h3>5. ~10% of EPS Is Managed — A Quantitative Estimate</h3>
<p>The finding that typical misrepresentation is ~10 cents per dollar of EPS gives a concrete magnitude to earnings management. This is not trivial — 10% of EPS translates to 10% of stock price under P = EPS x P/E. It confirms that EPS management is economically significant.</p>
<h3>6. Acquisition Accounting Confirms the M&amp;A EPS Connection</h3>
<p>CFOs explicitly identify acquisition accounting as a vehicle for earnings management — setting up reserves at acquisition that are later released into earnings. This connects to Andrade (1997) and Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024): EPS concerns shape not only which deals get done and how they're structured but also how they're accounted for post-completion.</p>
<h3>7. Matching Preference Over Fair Value Supports EPS Stability</h3>
<p>The overwhelming preference for matching (92.2%) over fair value reflects the desire for earnings that are smooth, predictable, and capitalizable. Fair value accounting introduces mark-to-market volatility that makes earnings harder to capitalize (the P/E multiple becomes unstable). CFOs want the accounting system that produces the most capitalizable earnings.</p>
<h3>8. Declining Discretion Paradox</h3>
<p>CFOs say reporting discretion has declined — yet 20% of firms still manage earnings. The decline in discretion may push earnings management toward REAL actions (cutting R&amp;D, capex, employment) rather than accounting choices. This connects to Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016): when accrual management becomes harder, real earnings management (via repurchases, investment cuts) becomes more important.</p>

<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; Find 44.8% of S&amp;P 500 firms use EPS as a bonus metric. Dichev et al. confirm: 88.6% say executive compensation is a motivation for earnings management, and the interview evidence explicitly links compensation consultants to GAAP-based earnings hurdles.</li>
<li><strong>Brav, Graham, Harvey &amp; Michaely (2005)</strong> — &quot;Payout Policy in the 21st Century.&quot; The payout companion survey. 76.1% say &quot;increasing EPS&quot; is important for repurchase decisions. Dichev et al. provide the underlying logic: earnings exist for valuation, so managing earnings (including via repurchases) is managing valuation.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> — &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out investment. Dichev et al.'s finding that declining accounting discretion pushes toward real earnings management suggests repurchases may be increasingly important as an EPS management tool.</li>
<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> — &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Document repurchases as EPS management. Dichev et al. show the underlying motivation: hitting earnings benchmarks (92.9% agree) to influence stock price (93.5%).</li>
<li><strong>Andrade (1997)</strong> and <strong>Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024)</strong> — Both show EPS concerns shape M&amp;A. Dichev et al.'s interview evidence on acquisition accounting as an earnings management vehicle adds a post-deal dimension: EPS management continues after the deal closes through reserve management.</li>
<li><strong>Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997)</strong> — &quot;Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses.&quot; Dichev et al. provide the CFO-side confirmation: benchmark pressure (hitting earnings targets) is the #2 and #3 motivation for earnings management.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Dichev et al. confirm the foundation: CFOs see earnings as a valuation number (94.67%), manage it to influence stock price (93.5%), and define quality as sustainability (= capitalizability). This is the CFO's description of P = EPS x P/E in their own words.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — The &quot;one number&quot; finding — CFOs don't distinguish between earnings for different purposes — supports the claim that the same EPS used internally (for compensation, budgeting) is the same EPS used externally (for valuation via P/E multiples).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — The 20% prevalence of earnings management and 10% magnitude provide quantitative parameters for the EPS paradigm: the objective function is strong enough that one-fifth of firms actively manage the number, typically adjusting it by about 10%.</li>
