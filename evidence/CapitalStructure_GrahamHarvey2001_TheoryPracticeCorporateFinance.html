    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Graham &amp; Harvey's 2001 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper surveys 392 CFOs about capital budgeting, cost of capital, and capital structure practices. The results are &quot;both reassuring and puzzling.&quot; Reassuring: NPV (74.9%) and IRR (75.6%) are now the dominant capital budgeting tools, and CAPM (73.5%) is widely used for cost of equity. Puzzling: managers rely heavily on informal criteria that academic theory dismisses. <strong>EPS dilution is the single most important factor affecting equity issuance decisions</strong> (68.6% rate it important/very important, mean rating 2.84/4.0). Financial flexibility (59.4%) and credit ratings (57.1%) — not tax shields or distress costs — are the top factors for debt decisions. Bankruptcy costs are rated unimportant (1.24). Personal taxes are irrelevant (0.68-0.82). Jensen's free cash flow discipline hypothesis gets essentially zero support (0.33). The paper reveals a systematic gap between what academics teach and what practitioners do: executives use NPV and CAPM for capital budgeting but largely ignore academic capital structure theories when making financing decisions. For the EPS project, this paper is the single most important piece of direct survey evidence that managers care about EPS dilution — confirming the EPS paradigm's central assumption from the mouths of CFOs themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Critical finding for the EPS project:</strong> P/E multiples are used by 38.9% of firms always or almost always for capital budgeting — nearly as popular as payback. This is the COMPS-BASED valuation approach the EPS paradigm describes.</p>
<p><strong>Size effects:</strong> Large firms significantly more likely to use NPV (85.1% vs. 69.2%), sensitivity analysis (75.5% vs. 37.5%), and simulation (28.3% vs. 4.6%). Small firms are almost as likely to use payback as NPV (54.4% vs. 69.2%). <strong>Highly levered firms are significantly more likely to use P/E multiples</strong> (growth firms 1.00** vs. nongrowth 2.37).</p>

<p><strong>Table 5 — Discount rates for overseas projects:</strong></p>
<p>Most firms (58.8%) use the company-wide discount rate even for overseas projects. Only 15.6% use a divisional rate, and fewer than 10% use project-specific component cash flow rates. Large firms are significantly more likely to use risk-matched rates. This suggests practitioners apply a single &quot;cost of capital&quot; broadly — consistent with using the earnings yield as a universal hurdle rate.</p>

<p><strong>Financial flexibility is #1.</strong> The desire to have enough internal funds for future projects is the most important debt factor — rated 2.59 overall, 2.40*** for dividend payers. This is NOT the pecking order's information asymmetry story; flexibility is equally important for dividend-paying firms (which should have LESS information asymmetry).</p>
<p><strong>Tax advantage is only moderately important</strong> (2.07) — not the dominant factor the trade-off model assumes. Personal taxes are essentially irrelevant (0.68 for debt, 0.82 for equity).</p>
<p><strong>Distress/bankruptcy costs are NOT important</strong> (1.24). This directly contradicts the trade-off model's second pillar. Even speculative-grade firms rate distress costs only 1.37** vs. investment-grade 1.02.</p>
<p><strong>Jensen's FCF discipline gets near-zero support</strong> (0.33). &quot;We find very little evidence that firms discipline managers in this way (mean rating of 0.33, the second lowest rating among all factors affecting debt policy in Table 6).&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Target debt ratios:</strong> 44% have strict or somewhat strict targets; 37% have flexible targets; 19% have no target. Large firms and investment-grade firms are more likely to have strict targets.</p>
<h4>5.2 Pecking Order (pp. 215-223)</h4>
<p><strong>Key findings on pecking order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firms value financial flexibility — consistent with pecking order, BUT flexibility is NOT related to information asymmetry proxies (size, growth, dividend status)</li>
<li>Firms issue debt when internal funds insufficient (2.13) — consistent with pecking order</li>
<li>Firms reluctant to issue equity when undervalued (2.69) — consistent</li>
<li>BUT: deeper analysis shows equity undervaluation's importance is NOT related to information asymmetry (not related to size, dividend status, or executive ownership)</li>
<li>&quot;In sum, the importance of financial flexibility and equity undervaluation to security issuance decisions is generally consistent with the pecking-order model of financing hierarchy. However, asymmetric information does not appear to CAUSE the importance of these factors.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timing of equity issuance:</strong> Stock price appreciation is the third most important equity factor (2.53). Consistent with &quot;window of opportunity&quot; (Loughran &amp; Ritter 1995) and market timing.</p>
<p><strong>Signaling:</strong> Very few firms use capital structure to signal (0.96 in Table 9). No support for Ross (1977) or Leland &amp; Pyle (1977).</p>
<h4>5.8.2 Common Stock — THE EPS DILUTION SECTION (pp. 229-230)</h4>
<p><strong>This is the single most important section for the EPS project.</strong></p>
<p>Graham &amp; Harvey directly investigate EPS dilution concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The textbook view is that earnings are not diluted if a firm earns the required return on the new equity. Conversely, if funds are obtained by issuing debt, the number of shares remains constant and so EPS can increase. However, the equity is levered and therefore more risky, so Modigliani and Miller's 'conservation of value' tells us that the stock price will not increase due to higher EPS. Nonetheless, Brealey and Myers (1996) indicate that there is a common belief among executives that share issuance dilutes earnings per share (on p. 396, Brealey and Myers call this view a 'fallacy').&quot;</p>

</table>
<p><strong>EPS dilution is the #1 factor</strong> for equity issuance at 68.55% (mean 2.84). Among public firms, it is even higher (3.18). Among dividend-paying firms: 3.06***.</p>
<p><strong>Graham &amp; Harvey's commentary (p. 230):</strong> &quot;either indicates that executives focus more than they should on earnings dilution (if the standard textbook view is correct), or that the standard textbook treatment misses an important aspect of earnings dilution.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Cross-sectional patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EPS dilution concern is especially strong among: large firms (3.12**), public firms (3.18), dividend payers (3.06***), regulated firms (3.60), manufacturing firms (2.60***)</li>
<li>EPS dilution is LESS important when the CEO has an MBA (2.62) than when they don't (2.95) — &quot;perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!&quot;</li>
<li>The cheapest source of funds is rated only 1.10 — firms do NOT think of equity as cheap or expensive in the textbook sense</li>
</ul>
<h4>Table 12 — Summary of Theory vs. Survey Evidence (pp. 233-236)</h4>
<p>The final row of Table 12 is: <strong>&quot;Earnings per share dilution&quot; → &quot;most important factor affecting equity issuance decision.&quot;</strong> This is listed alongside all the academic theories as a separate empirical finding.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Conclusions (pp. 232-233)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In our analysis of capital structure, we find that informal criteria such as financial flexibility and credit ratings are the most important debt policy factors. Other informal criteria such as EPS dilution and recent stock price appreciation are the most important factors influencing equity issuance.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;we find moderate support that firms follow the trade-off theory and target their debt ratio. Other results, such as the importance of equity undervaluation and financial flexibility, are generally consistent with the pecking-order view. However, the evidence in favor of these theories does not hold up as well under closer scrutiny.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;financial executives are much less likely to follow the academically proscribed factors and theories when determining capital structure. This last finding raises possibilities that require additional thought and research. Perhaps the relatively weak support for many capital structure theories indicates that it is time to critically reevaluate the assumptions and implications of these mainline theories.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. THE Smoking Gun: EPS Dilution Is the #1 Equity Issuance Factor</h3>
<p>This is the most direct survey evidence for the EPS paradigm's central assumption. When 392 CFOs are asked what factors affect their equity issuance decisions, EPS dilution ranks #1 at 68.55%, above stock undervaluation (66.9%), recent stock appreciation (62.6%), and maintaining target D/E (51.6%). The survey directly confirms that managers think about EPS when making financing decisions — the textbook view that this is a &quot;fallacy&quot; notwithstanding. Graham &amp; Harvey themselves note this is either irrational (if the textbook is right) or indicates the textbook &quot;misses an important aspect.&quot; The EPS paradigm says the textbook misses everything.</p>
<h3>2. P/E Multiples Are Widely Used for Capital Budgeting</h3>
<p>38.9% of firms always or almost always use P/E multiples for project evaluation — nearly as popular as payback (56.7%). This directly supports the EPS paradigm's investor-side companion: firms value projects using multiples (comps), not just DCF. Highly levered firms are significantly more likely to use P/E multiples, consistent with EPS-focused firms applying earnings-based valuation.</p>
<h3>3. Financial Flexibility Is About Maintaining EPS Capacity, Not Information Asymmetry</h3>
<p>Financial flexibility is the #1 debt factor (59.4%), but Graham &amp; Harvey show it is NOT driven by pecking-order information asymmetry considerations. The EPS paradigm offers a simpler explanation: managers maintain financial flexibility (reserve borrowing power) so they can borrow to fund future EPS-accretive activities (buybacks, investments above the earnings yield) without being forced to issue equity (which dilutes EPS).</p>
<h3>4. Tax Shields Are Only Moderately Important; Distress Costs Are Unimportant</h3>
<p>The two pillars of the trade-off model — tax shields and distress costs — receive only moderate (2.07) and low (1.24) ratings respectively. This confirms that the trade-off model's theoretical factors are NOT what drives real capital structure decisions. The EPS paradigm explains this: managers care about the EPS effect of debt (earnings yield vs. borrowing rate), not about tax shields per se.</p>
<h3>5. Jensen's FCF Discipline Gets Zero Support</h3>
<p>&quot;We find very little evidence that firms discipline managers in this way&quot; (0.33/4.0). Jensen's (1986) canonical explanation for debt creation — disciplining managers to disgorge free cash flow — is essentially rejected by the managers themselves. The EPS paradigm explains the same leverage patterns (mature firms using debt) without requiring a disciplinary mechanism: debt boosts EPS when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate.</p>
<h3>6. Credit Ratings Are #2 — Borrowing CAPACITY for EPS Accretion</h3>
<p>Credit ratings (57.1%) are the second most important debt factor. In the EPS paradigm, managers care about credit ratings because ratings determine borrowing costs. A better rating means cheaper debt, widening the spread between the earnings yield and the borrowing rate, making leverage more EPS-accretive. Managers manage credit ratings to maintain their ability to borrow cheaply for EPS-boosting purposes.</p>
<h3>7. &quot;Common Stock Is Cheapest Source of Funds&quot; Rated Only 1.10</h3>
<p>Only 14% of firms consider whether equity is the cheapest source. This directly contradicts the MM/CAPM framework where equity has a well-defined &quot;cost&quot; (required return). In the EPS paradigm, this makes sense: managers don't compute a cost of equity from CAPM — they think about whether issuing shares will dilute EPS. The &quot;cost&quot; of equity is the earnings yield (the EPS they give up per dollar of new equity), not the CAPM-derived required return.</p>
<h3>8. The Theory-Practice Gap IS the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Graham &amp; Harvey document that managers use NPV/IRR for capital budgeting but ignore academic capital structure theories. The EPS paradigm explains this gap: managers have adopted DCF for project evaluation (it became the standard) but still use earnings-based reasoning for financing decisions because financing directly affects EPS. The &quot;gap&quot; exists because academics assumed the same framework (NPV) governs both investment and financing, when in practice EPS governs financing.</p>
<h3>9. MBA Education Reduces EPS Concerns — Modestly</h3>
<p>CEOs with MBAs rate EPS dilution at 2.62 vs. 2.95 for non-MBAs. Graham &amp; Harvey speculate &quot;perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!&quot; This is remarkable: MBA education partially suppresses EPS-based thinking, but even MBA-educated CFOs still rate EPS dilution at 2.62/4.0 — well above most academic theory-based factors. The EPS paradigm is deeply embedded in managerial culture, resistant even to formal education in NPV-based finance.</p>
<h3>10. Stigler's &quot;Economic Darwinism&quot; Defense Applies to the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>In the appendix (p. 239), Graham &amp; Harvey discuss Stigler's (1966) point that managers may deny maximizing profits while actually doing so. They invoke Friedman's (1953) pool player analogy: firms may use correct methods without knowing it. For the EPS paradigm, the inverse applies: even if managers SAY they maximize NPV (when asked abstract questions), their REVEALED preferences (EPS dilution as #1 equity factor) show they maximize EPS. The survey reveals what managers actually care about, not what they think they should say.</p>
