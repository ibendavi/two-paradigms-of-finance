    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Myron Gordon's 1959 <em>Review of Economics and Statistics</em> paper provides the first rigorous empirical test of whether stock prices depend on dividends AND earnings separately, or on earnings alone. Using cross-sectional regressions for four industries over two years (1951 and 1954), Gordon shows that dividends and retained earnings have DIFFERENT price multipliers — with dividends consistently valued more highly than retained earnings. This rejects the &quot;earnings hypothesis&quot; (that only total earnings matter for price) in favor of the &quot;dividend hypothesis&quot; (that the division of earnings between dividends and retained earnings affects price). The paper provides the theoretical foundation: P₀ = (1-b)Y₀/(k-br), where b is the retention rate and r is the return on reinvested earnings. The earnings hypothesis requires that k (the required rate of profit) be independent of dividend policy — but Gordon's data reject this. For the EPS project, this paper is critical because it tests the very premise of P = E/k: if dividends matter separately from earnings, then the simple earnings capitalization formula is incomplete.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Three Hypotheses (pp. 99-100)</h3>
<p>Gordon frames the debate as testing three models:</p>
<p><strong>Model I: Dividend + Income</strong> (the broadest)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P = a₀ + a₁D + a₂Y</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where P = price, D = dividend, Y = income (earnings). If a₁ = a₂, dividends and earnings are perfect substitutes; if a₁ ≠ a₂, the division matters.</p>
<p><strong>Model II: Dividend + Retained Earnings</strong> (equivalent to Model I, different parameterization)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P = a₀ + a₁D + a₂(Y - D)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here if a₁ ≠ a₂, the price impact of a dollar paid as dividends differs from a dollar retained.</p>
<p><strong>Model III: Earnings Only</strong> (the earnings hypothesis)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P = f(Y) alone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the EPS paradigm's pricing model: P = E × (P/E), where only the level of earnings matters for price.</p>
<h3>Empirical Results: Table 1 (pp. 100-101)</h3>

<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>R² ranges from .86 to .93 — both dividends and earnings explain 86-93% of cross-sectional price variation</li>
<li>In 6 of 8 cases, a₁ &gt; a₂ — the dividend coefficient exceeds the earnings coefficient</li>
<li>The difference is most dramatic for Chemicals 1951 (a₁ = 12.3, a₂ = -0.4)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 2: Testing Whether Dividend ≠ Retained Earnings (pp. 101-102)</h3>
<p>Model II regressions (P = a₀ + a₁D + a₂(Y-D)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In each case the coefficients of dividend and retained earnings differ, in some instances quite dramatically. Furthermore... for five of the eight samples, the hypothesis that [the coefficients] are equal is rejected at the 5 per cent level.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the key result: in 5 of 8 industry-year samples, statistical tests REJECT the hypothesis that dividends and retained earnings have the same impact on price. Dividends are valued more highly.</p>
<h3>The Theoretical Framework (pp. 102-104)</h3>
<p>Gordon derives the pricing formula from first principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = D₁/(k - g) = (1-b)Y₀/(k - br)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>b = fraction of earnings retained (retention rate)</li>
<li>r = rate of return on reinvested earnings</li>
<li>k = rate of profit required by investors (cost of equity)</li>
<li>g = br = growth rate of dividends and earnings</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>earnings hypothesis</strong> requires that k be independent of b (the retention/dividend rate). If k doesn't depend on how earnings are split between dividends and retention, then the division doesn't affect price, and only total earnings matter.</p>
<p>Gordon argues this fails because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An investor buying a share of stock is acquiring a share of a corporation's future earnings. What can he do with these future earnings? He can (a) receive them as dividends or (b) receive them through sale of stock.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, when he sells the stock, the buyer is also acquiring a share of the corporation's future earnings... We therefore have an infinite regress — and the limit of which is the dividend series.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the &quot;bird in the hand&quot; argument: dividends are certain and immediate; retention promises uncertain future returns. Therefore investors should discount retained earnings more heavily (require higher k when b is higher).</p>
<h3>Refinements: Averages vs. Deviations (pp. 104-105)</h3>
<p>Gordon refines the model by distinguishing between the firm's long-run average dividend rate (d̄) and its deviation from the average (d - d̄), and similarly for growth (ḡ vs. g - ḡ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P/B = f(d̄, d - d̄, ḡ, g - ḡ) (equation 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regression results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average dividend rate (d̄) has a large positive coefficient</li>
<li>The deviation (d - d̄) has a smaller but positive coefficient</li>
<li>The average growth rate (ḡ) is positive and significant</li>
<li>The deviation (g - ḡ) has a smaller coefficient</li>
</ul>
<p>This means investors respond to PERSISTENT dividend policy more than to transient fluctuations — long-run payout matters more than year-to-year variation.</p>
<h3>The Industries Selected (p. 100)</h3>
<p>Gordon deliberately chooses industries with different characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemicals</strong>: High growth, high retention</li>
<li><strong>Foods</strong>: Stable, high payout</li>
<li><strong>Steels</strong>: Cyclical</li>
<li><strong>Machine Tools</strong>: Highly cyclical</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that dividends matter across ALL industry types strengthens the result — it's not an artifact of one industry's peculiarities.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. A Direct Test of P = E × (P/E)</h3>
<p>The EPS paradigm's pricing model — P = E(EPS) × P/E — implies that only the LEVEL of earnings matters for price, with the P/E ratio determined by comparables. Gordon's paper tests this directly (his &quot;Model III: earnings only&quot;) and finds it incomplete. The division between dividends and retained earnings matters. This is a challenge the EPS paradigm must address: if the payout ratio affects price, then P/E ratios are not solely determined by comps but also by payout policy.</p>
<h3>2. But the Earnings Yield Dominates</h3>
<p>Despite rejecting the pure earnings hypothesis, Gordon's R² values for the earnings-only model are still very high (Table 1 footnotes suggest R² around .70-.85 for earnings alone). Earnings explain most of the cross-sectional variation in prices; dividends provide incremental explanatory power. The EPS paradigm is not wrong — it's a first-order approximation that captures most of the variation.</p>
<h3>3. The P/E Ratio Depends on Payout — Which Managers Know</h3>
<p>If P/E = f(payout ratio), then EPS-maximizing managers face a portfolio of tools: they can boost EPS (which raises E in P = E × P/E) but they must also manage the payout ratio to maintain or increase the P/E multiple. This creates a nuanced optimization: maximize EPS while maintaining a payout ratio that supports the multiple. This is exactly what practitioners do — manage &quot;earnings quality&quot; and &quot;shareholder returns&quot; simultaneously.</p>
<h3>4. Gordon's Formula Is the Earnings Capitalization Formula with Growth</h3>
<p>P₀ = (1-b)Y₀/(k-br) is the Gordon Growth Model (GGM). When b = 0 (all earnings paid as dividends), P₀ = Y₀/k — the pure earnings capitalization formula. Growth (br &gt; 0) modifies it. The EPS paradigm's P = E/r is the GGM with b = 0 or equivalently with the growth effect folded into r.</p>
<h3>5. The &quot;Bird in Hand&quot; Is a Practitioner Argument</h3>
<p>Gordon's reasoning — that dividends are valued more because they're certain — is the practitioner's argument, not the academic's. MM (1961) will argue this is a fallacy (the &quot;bird in the hand&quot; fallacy). The debate between Gordon and MM on dividends parallels the debate between practitioners and academics on the role of earnings vs. cash flows.</p>
<h3>6. Cross-Sectional Evidence = Comparables</h3>
<p>Gordon's methodology — comparing P, D, and Y across firms within an industry — IS the comparables approach. He's showing that within an industry, price varies systematically with dividends and earnings. This is what practitioners do when they apply P/E multiples: compare firms within an industry and adjust for payout and growth differences.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — MM's dividend irrelevance theorem directly contradicts Gordon's findings. MM argue that in perfect markets, dividend policy doesn't affect value; Gordon's data show dividends are valued more than retained earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon &amp; Shapiro (1956)</strong> — The earlier Gordon-Shapiro paper derives the constant-growth formula P = D/(k-g), which this paper extends and tests empirically.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — Lintner's finding that firms smooth dividends implies that the &quot;average dividend rate&quot; (d̄) in Gordon's refined model captures the firm's TARGET payout, not random variation.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934/1940)</strong> — Graham &amp; Dodd's valuation formula P = M(D + E/3) = M × (4D/3 + E/3... actually D + E/3) places more weight on dividends than earnings — the same asymmetry Gordon documents empirically.</li>
<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — Williams's dividend discount model (V = sum of discounted future dividends) is the theoretical foundation for Gordon's &quot;bird in the hand&quot; argument that dividends are the ultimate source of value.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon acknowledges that dividends affect price in the &quot;traditional view&quot; and that this is one area where MM's theoretical conclusions may not hold empirically.</li>
<li><strong>Cragg &amp; Malkiel (1982)</strong> — Their later cross-sectional study of how growth expectations affect P/E ratios extends Gordon's work by using analyst forecasts rather than historical data.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Gordon's paper challenges the pure EPS paradigm (P = E × P/E) by showing payout matters. But it also supports it: earnings are the DOMINANT factor (R² = .86-.93 with dividends), and the division between D and Y-D is a second-order refinement.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — Gordon's evidence that dividends are valued more than retained earnings implies that EPS-maximizing managers face a trade-off: retaining earnings to fund EPS-accretive investments vs. paying dividends to support the P/E multiple. The dividend paper should address this.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Gordon (1959) represents the last major pre-MM challenge to earnings-only valuation. After MM (1961) and the rise of CAPM, the academic consensus shifted to viewing dividends as irrelevant. But Gordon's empirical finding persists in the data.</li>
