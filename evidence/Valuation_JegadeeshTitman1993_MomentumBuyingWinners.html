    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Jegadeesh &amp; Titman's 1993 <em>Journal of Finance</em> paper documents that trading strategies which buy stocks that have performed well over the past 3 to 12 months and sell stocks that have performed poorly over the same period generate significant positive returns over the subsequent 3 to 12 months. The best-performing strategy selects stocks based on their returns over the previous 6 months and holds them for 6 months, generating a compounded excess return of 12.01% per year. Momentum profits are not due to systematic risk: the beta of the winners-minus-losers portfolio is negative (-0.08). The profits exist within all size and beta subsamples and are robust across five-year subperiods from 1965-1989. However, approximately half of the excess returns dissipate within the following two years (cumulative returns peak at ~9.5% at month 12, then decline to ~4% by month 36), suggesting the returns are partially temporary. Analysis of earnings announcement returns confirms the source: winners show significantly positive 3-day returns around earnings announcements in the first 6 months (+0.55 to +0.90% per announcement), while the pattern reverses in months 13-18. About 25% of momentum profits are realized during earnings announcement windows. For the EPS project, this paper is significant because it demonstrates that the market's short-run pricing responds to earnings surprises with a lag — the momentum effect is substantially driven by delayed incorporation of earnings information into prices, consistent with the EPS paradigm's view that P = E(EPS) x P/E adjusts gradually as EPS expectations are updated.</p>

<p>All 16 strategies are profitable and statistically significant (t &gt; 2.86). The 6-month/6-month strategy — the authors' baseline — generates <strong>1.01% per month (t = 3.67) = 12.01% per year compounded</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>With 1-week lag</strong> (to avoid bid-ask bounce and short-term reversal): returns increase slightly, confirming the effect is not due to microstructure.</p>
<h3>Section II: Sources of Relative Strength Profits (pp. 72-75)</h3>
<p><strong>Decomposition of momentum profits (Eq. 3):</strong></p>
<p>The expected profit of the zero-cost relative strength strategy can be decomposed into three components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cross-sectional dispersion in expected returns (σ²_μ):</strong> If some stocks have persistently higher expected returns, buying recent winners captures this. Always positive.</li>
<li><strong>Serial covariance of the common factor (market):</strong> If the market exhibits positive autocorrelation, momentum profits arise mechanically. Can be positive or negative.</li>
<li><strong>Average serial covariance of firm-specific (idiosyncratic) returns:</strong> If individual stocks' idiosyncratic returns are positively serially correlated, momentum strategies profit from this. Can be positive or negative.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key empirical finding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market factor's serial covariance is slightly NEGATIVE (consistent with mean reversion in the aggregate market), which would REDUCE momentum profits</li>
<li>The firm-specific serial covariance is POSITIVE (0.0012), which GENERATES momentum profits</li>
<li>Conclusion: <strong>momentum is driven by firm-specific underreaction</strong>, not common factor dynamics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section III: Cross-Sectional Analysis (pp. 75-78)</h3>

<p>The beta of the winners-minus-losers portfolio is <strong>-0.08</strong> — meaning winners have slightly LOWER betas than losers. Momentum is emphatically NOT compensation for systematic risk; if anything, it goes against risk.</p>
<p><strong>Lead-lag model test:</strong> Profits are negatively related to lagged squared market returns, ruling out the explanation that momentum comes from large stocks leading small stocks.</p>

<p>The strategy loses heavily in January (average -6.86%, positive only 8% of Januaries). This is the mirror image of De Bondt &amp; Thaler's (1985) January effect: prior losers spike in January (helping the contrarian strategy, hurting the momentum strategy). April is the strongest month (3.33%, positive 96% of time), consistent with institutional rebalancing and pension fund flows.</p>
<p>Excluding January, the strategy is positive in every remaining month and profitable 71% of the time.</p>

<p><strong>The inverted U-shape is the key finding:</strong> Cumulative returns peak at approximately 9.5% around month 12, then decline to about 4% by month 36. <strong>Approximately half of momentum returns are temporary</strong> — they reverse over the subsequent two years.</p>
<p><strong>Risk cannot explain the reversal:</strong> The beta of the zero-cost portfolio starts at -0.20 in month 1 and rises to about 0.02 by month 8. If declining risk caused declining returns, beta should fall — but it rises. Risk changes go in the wrong direction.</p>
<h3>Section VII: Back-Testing the Strategy Pre-1965 (pp. 85-87)</h3>
<p><strong>Table VIII Panel A — 1927-1940:</strong></p>
<p>The momentum strategy is <strong>strongly negative</strong> in this period: cumulative -40.81% by month 36. Two factors explain this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many loser-decile firms were near bankruptcy with very high betas (~0.5 for the zero-cost portfolio vs. the equally weighted index)</li>
<li>The market exhibited strong mean reversion, with several massive reversals (five months where the strategy lost over 40%, all during sharp market rebounds from lows)</li>
</ol>
<p>The 1930s were characterized by extreme volatility and market-wide mean reversion that overwhelmed firm-specific momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Table VIII Panel B — 1941-1964:</strong></p>
<p>Returns are similar to the modern period: positive in months 2-12, then dissipating. The pattern confirms that momentum is robust outside the primary sample period, though weaker in the pre-war era of extreme volatility.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Months 1-6:</strong> Winners realize significantly HIGHER returns around their earnings announcements — meaning their earnings are surprising the market positively. The market had NOT fully incorporated the positive information reflected in past returns.</li>
<li><strong>Months 13-18:</strong> The pattern REVERSES — losers now have higher earnings announcement returns than winners. The initial momentum was partly based on temporary factors that reverse.</li>
<li><strong>~25% of the zero-cost portfolio's returns</strong> over the 6-month holding period are earned within the 3-day windows around quarterly earnings announcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is consistent with Bernard &amp; Thomas (1990), who document post-earnings-announcement drift: the market doesn't fully react to earnings surprises, and subsequent earnings announcements in the same direction generate additional returns.</p>
<h3>Section IX: Conclusions (pp. 89-90)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers realize significant abnormal returns over the 1965 to 1989 period.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>6m/6m strategy: <strong>12.01% per year</strong> compounded excess return</li>
<li>Not due to systematic risk (negative beta)</li>
<li>Not due to lead-lag effects</li>
<li>Consistent with <strong>delayed price reactions to firm-specific information</strong></li>
<li>Half of excess returns dissipate within 2 years (partial reversal)</li>
<li>Earnings announcement returns confirm firm-specific information drives the effect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two possible interpretations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Positive feedback trading</strong> (De Long et al. 1990): momentum traders push prices away from fundamental value temporarily, generating both the initial momentum and the eventual reversal</li>
<li><strong>Underreaction to short-term prospects, overreaction to long-term prospects</strong>: the market responds slowly to clear near-term signals (like recent earnings) but overextrapolates their long-term implications</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors cannot distinguish between these interpretations.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Momentum Is Earnings-Driven — The Announcement Return Evidence</h3>
<p>The most important finding for the EPS paradigm is Table IX: 25% of momentum profits are earned in 3-day windows around quarterly earnings announcements. This means momentum is substantially about the market's delayed reaction to EARNINGS information. In the EPS paradigm, P = E(EPS) x P/E. When earnings surprise positively, E(EPS) rises but the price does not fully adjust immediately. The momentum effect captures the slow upward revision of E(EPS) expectations, quarter by quarter.</p>
<h3>2. The Inverted U-Shape Reflects P/E Dynamics</h3>
<p>The cumulative return pattern — rising for 12 months, then declining for 24 months — maps directly onto P/E dynamics in the EPS paradigm. In the first 12 months, the market gradually adjusts the P/E upward (for winners) as earnings confirmations arrive. After 12 months, the P/E has overshot and begins reverting. The peak at month 12 is the point of maximum P/E overshoot; the subsequent decline is P/E mean reversion. This connects momentum (JT 1993) to overreaction reversal (De Bondt &amp; Thaler 1985) through the same P/E mechanism.</p>
<h3>3. Momentum Profits Are Firm-Specific, Not Market-Wide</h3>
<p>The decomposition in Section II shows momentum comes from firm-specific serial correlation, not common factor dynamics. In the EPS paradigm, this means momentum is about individual firms' earnings trajectories, not about market-wide sentiment. When a firm's EPS growth is positive, the market underreacts because analysts update EPS forecasts slowly (anchoring to prior forecasts). The serial correlation in idiosyncratic returns IS the serial correlation in earnings surprises.</p>
<h3>4. January Effect = Tax-Loss Selling Distorts P/E Temporarily</h3>
<p>The massive January reversal (-6.86% for momentum) is the flip side of De Bondt &amp; Thaler's January effect. In the EPS paradigm: tax-loss selling in December pushes losers' prices below their earnings-justified levels (depressing P/E below comps). In January, the price springs back to the comps-implied P/E, generating large loser returns that hurt the momentum strategy.</p>
<h3>5. Risk Goes the Wrong Way — Again</h3>
<p>As with De Bondt &amp; Thaler, the CAPM cannot explain momentum. Winners have LOWER betas than losers (beta of zero-cost = -0.08). The EPS paradigm doesn't need a risk explanation: momentum profits arise from the mechanical lag in P/E adjustment following earnings surprises. The &quot;risk&quot; of winners and losers is irrelevant; what matters is the speed at which E(EPS) expectations are updated and incorporated into the P/E multiple.</p>
<h3>6. The 1927-1940 Failure Confirms the EPS Mechanism</h3>
<p>The strategy's dramatic failure in 1927-1940 (-40.81% cumulative) is explained by (1) extreme market-wide volatility and mean reversion, and (2) many losers being near-bankruptcy firms with very high betas. In the EPS paradigm, the 1930s were a period when EPS collapsed for many firms (actual losses, not just low earnings), making the E(EPS) component of P = E(EPS) x P/E unreliable. When firms literally have negative earnings, the P/E-based pricing framework breaks down and stock prices detach from earnings — exactly when momentum fails.</p>
<h3>7. Bernard &amp; Thomas (1990) Connection — Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift</h3>
<p>Jegadeesh &amp; Titman note their findings are consistent with Bernard &amp; Thomas (1990), who document that prices drift in the direction of earnings surprises for several quarters. This is direct evidence that the market underreacts to earnings information — the central mechanism in the EPS paradigm. The drift is the delayed incorporation of earnings surprises into E(EPS) expectations and hence into price via P = E(EPS) x P/E.</p>
<h3>8. Momentum and Value Are Two Phases of the Same P/E Cycle</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, momentum (JT 1993, 3-12 months) and reversal (De Bondt &amp; Thaler 1985, 3-5 years) are two phases of the P/E cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1 (Momentum, 0-12 months):</strong> Earnings surprise → E(EPS) revises → P/E adjusts slowly upward → price drifts in the direction of the surprise</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 (Overshoot, 12-18 months):</strong> P/E overshoots as the market extrapolates the earnings trend beyond its true persistence</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3 (Reversal, 18-60 months):</strong> Earnings growth mean-reverts, P/E corrects back toward comps-implied level, generating the De Bondt &amp; Thaler reversal</li>
</ul>
<p>This three-phase cycle explains why both momentum and value &quot;work&quot; — they exploit different phases of the same underlying process.</p>

<li><strong>Shiller (1981)</strong> — &quot;Do Stock Prices Move Too Much?&quot; JT cite Shiller. The excess volatility that Shiller documents creates the conditions for both momentum (prices overshoot gradually) and reversal (prices eventually correct).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — JT's momentum is largely an EPS-driven phenomenon: 25% of profits come from earnings announcement windows, and the source is firm-specific (not market-wide). The EPS x P/E model explains momentum as the delayed adjustment of P/E to changes in E(EPS).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — The momentum effect is direct evidence of backward-looking pricing: prices respond to PAST earnings surprises with a lag, suggesting investors price based on trailing information that is slowly incorporated, rather than instantly discounting all future cash flows.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — The momentum effect implies that the earnings yield adjusts slowly to new information. When earnings are rising (falling), the earnings yield temporarily falls (rises) because price hasn't caught up (down). This creates predictable variation in the earnings yield spread — the &quot;People's Equity Risk Premium&quot; fluctuates with the momentum cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Crimes against Campbell-Shiller)</strong> — Both momentum and reversal challenge the present-value framework: if prices = PV(future cash flows), there should be no predictable patterns in returns based on past returns. Momentum and reversal are evidence that prices reflect P = E(EPS) x P/E with slow P/E adjustment, not instantaneous PV discounting.</li>
