    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Van Horne's textbook is a critical transitional document: it teaches the new post-MM value-maximization paradigm as the correct theoretical framework while simultaneously preserving extensive EPS-based analysis as the practical toolkit managers actually use. The EBIT-EPS chart is presented as the primary method for capital structure decisions in practice (Chapter 8), even as Chapter 7 declares that MM's theoretical framework should govern. The Appendix to Chapter 4 explicitly derives the conditions under which the earnings/price ratio equals the cost of equity capital -- and then dismisses those conditions as too restrictive, favoring the dividend discount model instead.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>1. The Firm's Objective Function (Chapter 1)</h3>
<p>Van Horne explicitly rejects EPS maximization as the firm's objective and replaces it with market-price-per-share maximization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We assume in this book that the objective of the firm is to maximize its value to its shareholders... Given the firm's strategic plan, this objective is equivalent to maximizing the market price of the firm's stock.&quot; (p. 3, based on context of Chapter 1 opening)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He identifies two broad decisions -- the investment decision and the financing decision -- and states that financial management must make these decisions &quot;in keeping with an over-all objective&quot; of maximizing the value of the firm to its shareholders. The goal is explicitly tied to maximizing the market price of the stock, not maximizing earnings per share.</p>
<p>However, Van Horne acknowledges a practical tension. In Chapter 4, when discussing the rationale for the weighted-average cost of capital, he notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cost of capital is only a means to an end -- namely, that of maximizing the market price of the stock. Unfortunately, it is easy to lose sight of the objective because of the somewhat mechanical nature of the approach.&quot; (p. 114)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in Chapter 4's discussion of project acceptance, he acknowledges that managers and investors care about earnings per share trends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Various authors contend that the marketplace values stability in earnings per share about a trend. They reason that to invest in a project that is expected to result in erratic earnings per share may have a depressing effect upon share price, despite the fact that its return on the equity-financed portion exceeds the cost of equity capital.&quot; (p. 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He cites Lerner-Rappaport and Robichek-Ogilvie-Roach (1968-1969) who propose that the firm should &quot;maximize the present value of a project, subject to the constraint of maintaining some minimum trend in earnings per share.&quot; This is a remarkable concession: even within the value-maximization framework, EPS stability is acknowledged as a binding practical constraint.</p>
<h3>2. Valuation Framework (Chapter 2)</h3>
<p>Van Horne builds his valuation framework entirely on the present value of future dividends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_0 = Sum of D_t / (1 + k_e)^t  for t = 1 to infinity     (Eq. 4-5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where D_t is the expected dividend per share in period t and k_e is the required rate of return (cost of equity). This is the pure dividend discount model (DDM). Earnings capitalization does not appear as a standalone valuation model. The P/E ratio appears only as a derivative concept, never as a fundamental valuation tool.</p>
<p>For growth firms, the constant-growth perpetuity model is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_0 = D_1 / (k_e - g)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Horne's valuation chapter (Chapter 2) builds from basic present-value concepts through bonds to stocks, always using discounted future cash flows. The progression is entirely within the NPV paradigm.</p>
<h3>3. Cost of Capital (Chapter 4 and its Appendix)</h3>
<p><strong>Cost of equity capital</strong> is defined as the rate of discount that equates the present value of expected future dividends per share with the current market price of the stock (Eq. 4-5 solved for k_e). This is emphatically NOT the earnings yield. Van Horne states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cost of equity capital is by far the most difficult cost to measure. In theory, it may be defined as the minimum rate of return that the company must earn on the equity-financed portion of an investment project in order to leave unchanged the market price of the stock.&quot; (p. 94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He constructs the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as the acceptance criterion for projects (Chapter 4 example: debt 4%, preferred 8%, common 11%, retained earnings 10%, giving WACC of 8.2%).</p>
<p><strong>The Appendix to Chapter 4 (pp. 115-117) is the most important passage for the EPS research program.</strong> Titled &quot;Earnings/Price Ratio and the Cost of Equity Capital,&quot; it directly addresses whether E/P can serve as the cost of equity. Van Horne uses the famous IBM paradox to argue against the E/P ratio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Earlier in this chapter, we suggested that, as a general rule, it is inappropriate to employ the ratio of current earnings per share to current market price per share as a measure of the cost of equity capital. In most cases, the earnings/price ratio is not a realistic estimate of the return that investors expect to receive. One need only point to the famous IBM paradox to illustrate the point. With a market price per share of around $340 in February of 1970 and earnings per share of $8.21 in 1969, IBM had an earnings/price ratio of 2.4 per cent. Certainly investors expected to receive more than a 2.4 per cent return...&quot; (p. 115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then derives two special cases where k_e = E/P:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1 (No-growth firm):</strong> If future EPS is expected to equal current EPS forever and the payout ratio is 100%, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_0 = E_0 / k_e, therefore k_e = E_0 / P_0     (Eq. 4A-3, 4A-4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Case 2 (Expansion firm, not growth firm):</strong> If the firm reinvests at exactly k_e (earns zero economic profit on new investment), the E/P ratio still equals k_e. Van Horne works through the algebra (Eqs. 4A-5 through 4A-13) showing that when the return on reinvested earnings equals k_e:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_0 = (1 - b)E_0 / (k_e - bk_e) = E_0 / k_e, therefore k_e = E_0 / P_0     (Eq. 4A-12, 4A-13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then concludes: &quot;Thus, for a firm which fulfills the assumptions made earlier, the cost of equity capital is the earnings/price ratio. The most important of these is that it does not have investment opportunities that are expected to return more than k_e. For growth situations where the firm has projects yielding more than k_e on the equity-financed portion, the earnings/price ratio understates the firm's cost of equity capital.&quot; (p. 117)</p>
<p>This is the academic argument that replaced earnings capitalization with the DDM: the E/P ratio is &quot;correct&quot; only for non-growth firms or firms earning exactly their cost of capital on reinvestment. For growth firms, E/P &lt; k_e, making the earnings yield a biased (low) estimate.</p>
<h3>4. Capital Structure: Theory vs. Practice</h3>
<p><strong>Chapter 7 (Theory of Capital Structure)</strong> presents MM's propositions as the dominant theoretical framework. Van Horne uses Durand's (1952) NI (Net Income) and NOI (Net Operating Income) approaches as the traditional framework, then shows how MM formalized the NOI approach. Key equations:</p>
<ul>
<li>MM without taxes: V = O / rho_k (total value = operating income / capitalization rate), and k_o is constant regardless of leverage.</li>
<li>MM with taxes: V = O(1 - t) / rho_k + tB     (Eq. 7-7), where tB is the tax shield.</li>
<li>Tax-adjusted cost of capital: k_o = rho_k [1 - t(B/(B+S))]     (Eq. 7-8)</li>
</ul>
<p>Van Horne presents the traditional view and MM side by side, giving MM significant weight. He notes: &quot;In practice, however, the majority of academicians and financial managers favor the traditional approach because of imperfections in the capital markets that hamper the perfect functioning of the arbitrage process.&quot; (p. 218)</p>
<p>The chapter's problems are fascinating from the EPS perspective. Problem 1 asks students to compute firm values using Durand's NI method with an &quot;equity-capitalization rate of 12.5%.&quot; Problem 3 (the Blalock Corporation) provides a schedule where issuing debt to retire stock first raises and then lowers the stock price -- asking students to identify the optimal capital structure by observation of stock price. Problem 4 provides a complete capitalization table for two firms (Veblen and Knight) using the terms &quot;equity-capitalization rate&quot; and &quot;overall capitalization rate&quot; -- pure earnings capitalization language.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8 (Capital Structure Decision)</strong> is where practice enters. Van Horne opens by acknowledging the gap between theory and practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In practice, how does the financial manager determine the optimal capital structure for his particular firm? The real difficulty, of course, is in estimating the implicit costs of nonequity financing.&quot; (pp. 228-229)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EBIT-EPS chart is presented as the primary practical tool (pp. 230-232). The example: a firm with 800,000 shares wants to raise $10 million. Option A: sell 200,000 new shares at $50. Option B: issue 8% bonds. At EBIT = $8 million:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The indifference point is at EBIT = $4 million. Above it, debt financing produces higher EPS. Van Horne comments: &quot;Constructing an EBIT-EPS chart gives the financial manager information about the differential impact on earnings per share of alternative methods of financing.&quot; (p. 231)</p>
<p>Crucially, Van Horne immediately qualifies the EBIT-EPS approach: &quot;the method does not consider directly the implicit costs associated with debt&quot; (p. 232). He follows with cash-flow analysis and comparison of capital structure ratios as supplementary methods. But the EBIT-EPS chart comes first and receives the most detailed treatment.</p>
<h3>5. Dividend Policy (Chapters 9 and 10)</h3>
<p>Chapter 9 presents MM's dividend irrelevance proposition alongside Gordon's &quot;bird-in-the-hand&quot; argument. Van Horne gives both views substantial treatment. He notes the empirical evidence is mixed and presents Brigham-Gordon's regression study of utility stocks as one of the most careful empirical tests.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 covers practical dividend policy. The discussion is organized around earnings per share throughout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividend stability is discussed in terms of dividends per share relative to earnings per share (Figures 10-1 and 10-2 plot both on the same graph).</li>
<li>The Coleman Company case study (Figure 10-4) shows dividends per share tracking earnings per share from 1961-1969.</li>
<li>Stock dividends are analyzed in terms of their dilutive effect on EPS: &quot;Because the number of shares of stock outstanding is increased by 5 per cent, earnings per share of the company are reduced proportionately. Suppose that total net profit after taxes were $1 million. Before the stock dividend, earnings per share would be $2.50 ($1 million/400,000). After the stock dividend, earnings per share are $2.38 ($1 million/420,000).&quot; (p. 275)</li>
<li>Stock splits affect P/E ratios: &quot;it is conceivable that the price/earnings ratio might be somewhat lower than it would be if earnings per share were adjusted.&quot; (p. 277)</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire practical discussion treats EPS and dividends per share as the operative quantities managers and investors track.</p>
<h3>6. Specific Formulas</h3>
<p><strong>Earnings capitalization (from problems and traditional framework):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>S = E / k_e  (market value of equity = earnings to common / equity-capitalization rate) -- used in Chapter 7 problems</li>
<li>V = O / rho_k  (total firm value = operating income / overall capitalization rate) -- Durand's NOI approach</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Present-value / DDM framework (the &quot;correct&quot; approach per Van Horne):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>P_0 = Sum of D_t / (1 + k_e)^t     (Eq. 4-5)</li>
<li>P_0 = D_1 / (k_e - g)     (Gordon growth model, used throughout)</li>
<li>k_e = D_1/P_0 + g     (cost of equity as dividend yield plus growth)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When E/P = k_e (Appendix to Chapter 4):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>k_e = E_0 / P_0     (Eq. 4A-4 and 4A-13) -- but only when the firm has no growth opportunities returning more than k_e</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MM equations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>V = O(1-t)/rho_k + tB     (Eq. 7-7)</li>
<li>k_o = rho_k[1 - t(B/(B+S))]     (Eq. 7-8)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WACC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>k_o = w_d * k_d + w_p * k_p + w_e * k_e (weighted-average cost of capital, Chapter 4 numerical example gives 8.2%)</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>Van Horne (1971) is a pivotal document for the EPS research program for several reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. It captures the academic transition in real time.</strong> By 1971, the shift from EPS maximization to value maximization was well underway in elite academic circles, but the textbook reveals how incomplete this transition was. Van Horne declares value maximization as the objective (Chapter 1) but then fills the practical chapters with EPS-based analysis (EBIT-EPS charts, EPS dilution calculations, EPS stability as a constraint). The theory says &quot;maximize value&quot;; the practice sections say &quot;compare EPS under different financing alternatives.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. The Appendix to Chapter 4 is the smoking gun for how E/P was displaced.</strong> Van Horne explicitly derives the conditions under which the earnings yield equals the cost of equity -- and then restricts those conditions to non-growth firms. The IBM paradox (E/P = 2.4% when investors clearly expected much more) became the canonical argument against using earnings capitalization. But this argument applies only if one adopts the DDM framework: if investors price using P = EPS x P/E from comparables (as the EPS paradigm holds), then the E/P ratio is the earnings yield by construction, and the &quot;IBM paradox&quot; simply reflects a high P/E for a growth stock.</p>
<p><strong>3. The EBIT-EPS chart embeds EPS maximization in practice.</strong> Chapter 8's primary tool for the capital structure decision is to compare EPS under debt vs. equity financing. The chart's logic is: if EBIT exceeds the indifference point, debt produces higher EPS, so choose debt. This is exactly the EPS-maximization decision rule: issue debt when the cost of debt is below the earnings yield (i.e., when debt financing is EPS-accretive). Van Horne frames this as merely &quot;one method of analysis&quot; to be supplemented by cash-flow analysis, but it receives the most prominent and detailed treatment.</p>
<p><strong>4. The EPS constraint on capital budgeting reveals the paradigm tension.</strong> Van Horne cites Lerner-Rappaport (1968) and Robichek-Ogilvie-Roach (1969) who propose maximizing NPV &quot;subject to the constraint of maintaining some minimum trend in earnings per share.&quot; This hybrid formulation -- NPV maximization with an EPS constraint -- is an academic attempt to reconcile the theoretical framework with what managers actually do. It implicitly concedes that managers care about EPS and that this concern cannot be dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Van Horne preserves capitalization language throughout.</strong> Despite adopting the DDM as the &quot;correct&quot; framework, the textbook uses terms like &quot;equity-capitalization rate,&quot; &quot;after-tax capitalization rate,&quot; and &quot;overall capitalization rate&quot; extensively. The Chapter 7 problems ask students to work through Durand's NI approach using capitalization rates. The formulas V = E/k_e and S = E/k_e appear in problems even as the text insists the DDM is theoretically superior.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon (1963):</strong> Van Horne's footnotes cite Solomon's <em>Theory of Financial Management</em> repeatedly, especially on the E/P ratio and the expansion case (footnotes 11, 18, 20 in Chapter 4 and Appendix). Solomon's work was the bridge from earnings capitalization to the DDM; Van Horne completes that bridge by making the DDM the default while treating E/P as a special case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dean (1951):</strong> Dean's capital budgeting framework (which used the earnings yield as the cost of equity) is the antecedent to Van Horne's Appendix. Van Horne's Appendix effectively explains why Dean's approach &quot;works&quot; only for non-growth firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963):</strong> MM's propositions receive a full chapter (Chapter 7). Van Horne presents both the original (no-tax) and corrected (with-tax) versions, giving MM substantial intellectual authority while acknowledging &quot;the majority of academicians and financial managers favor the traditional approach.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guthmann and Dougall (1940s editions):</strong> The earlier generation of corporate finance textbooks organized entirely around earnings capitalization. Van Horne represents the next generation that has absorbed MM but hasn't fully abandoned the older framework in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brealey (1969, 1st ed. of Principles):</strong> Brealey's textbook, appearing just two years earlier, was more aggressive in adopting the NPV framework. Van Horne is more cautious, preserving more of the older EPS-based toolkit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lerner-Rappaport (1968) and Robichek-Ogilvie-Roach (1969):</strong> The proposal to maximize NPV subject to an EPS constraint is a direct precursor to modern &quot;EPS accretion/dilution&quot; analysis in M&amp;A and capital structure decisions. Van Horne's citation of these papers shows the academic world was already grappling with the fact that managers optimize EPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gordon, Myron (1962):</strong> The constant-growth DDM that Van Horne uses as his primary valuation tool derives from Gordon's work. Van Horne cites Gordon's <em>Investment, Financing and Valuation of the Corporation</em> repeatedly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The EBIT-EPS chart in later textbooks:</strong> The EBIT-EPS chart that Van Horne presents in Chapter 8 survives in virtually every corporate finance textbook through the present day, including Brealey-Myers-Allen. It remains the standard practical tool for analyzing leverage decisions, even as the theoretical sections of these textbooks insist that value maximization (not EPS maximization) is the correct objective.</p>
