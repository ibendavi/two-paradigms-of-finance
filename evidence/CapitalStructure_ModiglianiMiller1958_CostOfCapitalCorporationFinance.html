    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Modigliani &amp; Miller's 1958 <em>American Economic Review</em> paper proves that, under perfect markets, the total market value of a firm is independent of its capital structure (Proposition I) and that the expected yield on equity rises linearly with leverage (Proposition II). The key conceptual move is defining the &quot;cost of capital&quot; as X̄/V — the ratio of expected earnings to total market value — which they call the &quot;capitalization rate&quot; ρ_k for firms in the same risk class. This is literally the earnings yield. They prove that ρ_k is constant regardless of leverage, that equity yields rise with leverage because equity absorbs more risk, and that the cut-off rate for new investment is ρ_k regardless of how the investment is financed (Proposition III). Empirical tests on 43 electric utilities (1947-48) and 42 oil companies (1953) find no significant relationship between the cost of capital and leverage (r = 0.04 to 0.12), but a positive relationship between equity yields and leverage (r = 0.53), consistent with Propositions I and II. For the EPS project, this is the most important paper in the entire literature: it is the paper that changed the assumed objective function of corporate finance from EPS maximization to NPV/value maximization, and it explicitly grapples with the tension between its framework and the traditional EPS-based view.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Introduction: Two Approaches to Investment Decisions (pp. 261-264)</h3>
<p>MM open by identifying two approaches to investment decisions under uncertainty:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Profit maximization:</strong> The firm maximizes profit, i.e., earnings net of interest. This requires a single &quot;cost of capital&quot; rate.</li>
<li><strong>Market value maximization:</strong> The firm maximizes the market value of existing owners' shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under certainty these are equivalent, but under uncertainty they diverge. MM seek to establish when they are still equivalent — and the answer is: when market value maximization is the objective, the &quot;cost of capital&quot; is the capitalization rate ρ_k, which is the same regardless of capital structure.</p>
<h3>Section I.A: The Capitalization Rate for Uncertain Streams (pp. 264-268)</h3>
<p><strong>Risk classes (&quot;equivalent return&quot; classes):</strong>
Firms are grouped into classes such that shares of different firms within the same class are &quot;perfect substitutes&quot; — their returns are proportional. Within each class, the market will establish a single capitalization rate.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental equation (Eq. 1):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_j = (1/ρ_k) × X̄_j</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where p_j is the market value of firm j's equity + debt, ρ_k is the capitalization rate for class k, and X̄_j is the expected return on the firm's assets. Equivalently:</p>
<p><strong>Equation (2):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>X̄_j / p_j = ρ_k for all firms j in class k</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ρ_k IS the earnings yield.</strong> MM define it explicitly as: (a) the expected rate of return on equity of an unlevered firm, (b) the price per dollar of expected return, (c) the market rate of capitalization. This is the earnings-price ratio, the earnings yield, the capitalization rate — all the same concept.</p>
<h3>Section I.B: Propositions I, II, and the Arbitrage Proof (pp. 268-277)</h3>
<p><strong>Proposition I (Eq. 3):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V_j = (S_j + D_j) = X̄_j / ρ_k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The market value of any firm in class k is given by capitalizing its expected return at the rate ρ_k appropriate to its class, and is completely independent of its capital structure.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrage proof:</strong> If two firms have identical expected earnings but different capital structures, and one is valued more highly, an investor can profit by selling the overvalued firm and buying a replicating position in the undervalued firm. The key insight is &quot;homemade leverage&quot; — investors can borrow on personal account to replicate any corporate capital structure.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition II (Eq. 12):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i_j = ρ_k + (ρ_k - r) × D_j/S_j</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expected yield on equity (earnings per dollar of equity) rises linearly with the debt-equity ratio D/S, at a rate equal to the spread between ρ_k and the interest rate r. This is the &quot;leverage penalty&quot; — equity gets riskier as leverage rises, so the market demands a higher earnings yield on equity.</p>
<p><strong>For the EPS paradigm:</strong> Proposition II says that leverage DOES boost the earnings yield on equity (the earnings-per-dollar-of-equity rises), but this is exactly offset by the increase in the required rate of return on equity. In the EPS paradigm, managers see the numerator effect (EPS rises with leverage) and ignore the denominator effect (the market discount rate also rises). MM's framework says the two effects cancel exactly; the EPS paradigm says they don't cancel in practice because the P/E multiple doesn't adjust (or adjusts sluggishly) for leverage.</p>
<h3>Section I.C: Extensions (pp. 272-275)</h3>
<p><strong>Corporate income tax (Eqs. 10-12):</strong>
With tax rate τ, the after-tax capitalization rate becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X̄^τ/V = [X̄ - rD(1-τ) - rD] / V ≡ ρ_k^τ = a constant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This introduces a small tax advantage to debt: the tax shield rτD accrues to equity holders. But MM note the advantage is &quot;small&quot; — at 50% corporate tax rate, the advantage of debt over equity financing is only about 25%, not the 5x difference implied by the traditional view.</p>
<p><strong>Plurality of bond rates:</strong> The analysis extends to cases where different firms face different borrowing rates. The basic propositions remain valid.</p>
<h3>Section I.D: Comparison with &quot;Current Doctrines&quot; (pp. 275-280)</h3>
<p>MM directly critique the &quot;traditional view&quot; (which they associate with the practitioner and textbook literature):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The crucial element in the position — that the expected earnings-price ratio of the stock is largely unaffected by leverage up to some conventional limit — is rarely even regarded as something which requires explanation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The traditional view holds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The earnings-price ratio (E/P) on equity is roughly constant as leverage increases (up to some &quot;prudent&quot; limit)</li>
<li>Therefore the weighted average cost of capital FALLS with moderate leverage</li>
<li>There is an optimal capital structure minimizing the cost of capital</li>
</ul>
<p>MM cite Graham and Dodd (1951) Eq. 14: S_j = π̄_j / i_k* where the capitalization rate i_k* is constant — i.e., the market applies a FIXED P/E multiple to earnings available for common stock, regardless of leverage. MM argue this is wrong: if the P/E doesn't adjust for leverage, then arbitrage opportunities exist.</p>
<p><strong>The butter fat analogy:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Imagine that a dairy farmer is content to sell his whole milk to a wholesaler who bottles separately the cream and the thinned milk. Now if butter fat is worth more per unit weight than the thinned milk, the farmer might expect to gain by skimming the butter fat and selling it separately. But his gain would be short-lived. The wholesaler would simply reduce the price he pays for the skimmed milk to reflect its lower butter fat content.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MM formalize this (Eqs. a, b, c): the analogy maps exactly onto Propositions I and II. Just as skimming cream doesn't change the total value of milk, separating the earnings stream into debt + equity doesn't change total firm value.</p>
<p><strong>For the EPS paradigm:</strong> The traditional view that MM criticize IS essentially the EPS paradigm's assumption — that the market applies a roughly constant P/E to earnings-for-common, and therefore leverage changes EPS without a fully offsetting P/E adjustment. MM's entire contribution is to argue that this traditional view is wrong. The EPS paradigm's response: MM's arbitrage proof requires perfect markets and instantaneous adjustment, while in practice the P/E multiple is determined by comps, not by arbitrage.</p>
<h3>Section I.E: Preliminary Empirical Evidence (pp. 281-287)</h3>
<p><strong>Test of Proposition I (cost of capital invariant to leverage):</strong></p>
<p>Regression: x = X̄^τ/V on d = D/V</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Industry</th>
<th>Equation</th>
<th>r</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Electric utilities (43 firms, 1947-48)</td>
<td>x = 5.3 + 0.006d</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oil companies (42 firms, 1953)</td>
<td>x = 8.5 + 0.006d</td>
<td>0.04</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both correlation coefficients are &quot;very close to zero and not statistically significant.&quot; The data &quot;provide no evidence of any tendency for the cost of capital to fall as the debt ratio increases.&quot; Figures 3 and 4 show scatter diagrams with essentially flat relationships.</p>
<p>The constant terms estimate ρ_k^τ: ~5.3% for utilities, ~8.5% for oil companies — &quot;both in absolute value and relative spread&quot; consistent with a priori expectations.</p>
<p>No U-shaped relationship: Curvature tests show no statistically significant quadratic term — contradicting the traditional view that there is an optimal interior leverage ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Test of Proposition II (equity yield rises with leverage):</strong></p>
<p>Regression: z = π^τ/S on h = D/S</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both positive and significant (r = 0.53). The equity yield rises with leverage as Proposition II predicts. The constants estimate ρ_k^τ (capitalization rate for unlevered firms); the slopes should equal (ρ_k^τ - r).</p>
<p><strong>Curvature tests for Proposition II:</strong></p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Negative</strong> curvature in both cases — for utilities the square term is significant at 5%. This contradicts the traditional view (which predicts a horizontal or flat relation) and runs counter to a U-shaped cost of capital, but MM note it can be explained by the rising cost of borrowed funds at high leverage.</p>
<h3>Section II.A: Proposition III — The Cut-Off Rate for Investment (pp. 288-291)</h3>
<p><strong>Proposition III:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cut-off point for investment in the firm will in all cases be ρ_k and will be completely unaffected by the type of security used to finance the investment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The marginal cost of capital equals ρ_k regardless of whether the investment is financed by bonds, retained earnings, or new stock. MM prove this for all three cases:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1 — Bond financing:</strong> If the firm borrows I at rate r to invest at return ρ*:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S₁ = S₀ + (ρ*I/ρ_k) - I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investment increases stockholder wealth iff ρ* ≥ ρ_k. The borrowing rate r does not appear in the condition — only ρ_k matters.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2 — Retained earnings:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>W₁ = S₀ + ρ*I/ρ_k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wealth increases iff ρ* ≥ ρ_k.</p>
<p><strong>Case 3 — Common stock financing (Eq. 30):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₁ = P₀ + [1/(N+M)] × [(ρ* - ρ_k)/ρ_k] × I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Price per share rises iff ρ* &gt; ρ_k. The current earnings yield on common stock does NOT determine the hurdle rate.</p>
<p><strong>THE CRITICAL NUMERICAL EXAMPLE (p. 291):</strong></p>
<p>This is the most important passage in the paper for the EPS paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup: ρ_k = 10%, r = 4%, X̄ = 1,000, 50% debt, 1,000 shares, P₀ = $5.00</li>
<li>Current earnings yield on common equity: 800/5,000 = <strong>16%</strong></li>
<li>Investment: 100 units, expected yield 12%</li>
<li><strong>Traditional/EPS view:</strong> Don't invest! The 12% return is below the 16% earnings yield on common. Equity financing would dilute EPS.</li>
<li><strong>MM view:</strong> Invest! The 12% return exceeds ρ_k = 10%. The cut-off is ρ_k, not the equity yield.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if the firm issues 20 new shares at $5 to finance the investment:</p>
<ul>
<li>New V = 10,120, new S = 5,120</li>
<li>New P₁ = 5,120/1,020 = <strong>$5.02</strong> per share → price RISES by 0.4%</li>
<li>But EPS falls from $0.80 to <strong>$0.796</strong> → EPS FALLS by 0.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>MM's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What has happened is that the dilution in expected earnings per share (from .80 to .796) has been more than offset, in its effect upon the market price of the shares, by the decrease in leverage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is the exact point of disagreement between MM and the EPS paradigm.</strong> MM argue that the P/E adjusts upward to offset the EPS dilution, so stockholders gain despite lower EPS. The EPS paradigm argues that in practice, (a) the P/E does not adjust for leverage changes, and (b) managers are evaluated on EPS growth, so they reject the 12% project.</p>
<h3>Section II.B: Financial Planning by Firms (pp. 292-293)</h3>
<p>MM acknowledge that even within their framework, the FORM of financing can matter for practical reasons — even though it doesn't affect the investment decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the market uses &quot;current and recent past earnings in forming expectations,&quot; then equity issuance at the current (depressed) price may transfer wealth to new shareholders</li>
<li>A &quot;better course would be a pre-emptive issue of stock&quot; before announcing the project</li>
<li>Or finance initially with debt, then refinance with equity after earnings rise</li>
<li>Or use convertible securities that combine both steps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical footnote 52 (p. 292):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nor can we rule out the possibility that the existing owners, if unable to use a financing plan which protects their interest, may actually prefer to pass up an otherwise profitable venture rather than give outsiders an 'excessive' share of the business.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is MM explicitly acknowledging the EPS dilution problem.</strong> Even in their own framework, they recognize that managers/owners might reject positive-NPV projects because equity financing would dilute existing shareholders' earnings per share. They dismiss this as a market imperfection of significance &quot;only for small or new firms&quot; — but the EPS paradigm argues it is pervasive.</p>
<h3>Section II.C: Corporate Income Tax on Investment Decisions (pp. 293-296)</h3>
<p>With corporate taxes, the required returns become:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Financing method</th>
<th>Required return (numerical example)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>New common stock</td>
<td>ρ_k^S = ρ_k^τ/(1-τ) = <strong>20%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New debt</td>
<td>ρ_k^D = 16%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Retained earnings</td>
<td>ρ_k^R = <strong>15%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Using ρ_k^τ = 10%, r = 4%, τ = 50%, τ_d = 40% personal tax on dividends, τ_g = 20% capital gains tax.)</p>
<p>MM's striking observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We should at least like to call attention to the remarkably small difference between the 'cost' of equity funds and debt funds. With the numerical values assumed, equity money turned out to be only 25 per cent more expensive than debt money, rather than something on the order of 5 times as expensive as is commonly supposed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The traditional view (EPS paradigm) sees a huge gap because it compares the earnings yield (16%) to the borrowing rate (4%) — a 4:1 ratio. MM's framework says the true difference is much smaller because adding debt raises the required return on equity. This is the core disagreement about the cost of equity.</p>
<h3>Section III: Conclusion (p. 296)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With the development of Proposition III the main objectives we outlined in our introductory discussion have been reached. We have in our Propositions I and II at least the foundations of a theory of the valuation of firms and shares in a world of uncertainty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MM describe their approach as &quot;static, partial equilibrium analysis&quot; assuming &quot;atomistic competition in the capital markets&quot; and acknowledge &quot;drastic simplifications have been necessary.&quot;</p>
<h3>References (p. 297)</h3>
<p>22 references including: Dean (1951) <em>Capital Budgeting</em>; Durand (1952) on costs of debt and equity; Graham &amp; Dodd (1951) <em>Security Analysis</em> 3rd ed.; Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1955) <em>Corporate Financial Policy</em>; Keynes (1936); Lintner (1956) on dividends; Lutz &amp; Lutz (1951) <em>Theory of Investment of the Firm</em>; Williams (1938) <em>Theory of Investment Value</em>.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. MM (1958) Is the Paper That Changed the Objective Function</h3>
<p>Before MM, the standard framework in corporate finance textbooks (Dewing, Gerstenberg, Guthmann &amp; Dougall, Graham &amp; Dodd) was earnings capitalization: P = E/ρ, and the goal of financial management was to maximize EPS. MM (1958) changed the objective to &quot;maximize the market value of the firm.&quot; This paper is THE intellectual event that the maxEPS paradigm paper must document and explain. Everything in the EPS paradigm flows from the claim that MM changed the academic theory but NOT business practice.</p>
<h3>2. The &quot;Cost of Capital&quot; ρ_k IS the Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>MM's capitalization rate ρ_k is defined as X̄/V — expected earnings divided by total market value. This IS the earnings yield. The entire paper is built on earnings capitalization: P = X̄/ρ_k. The EPS paradigm's pricing equation P = EPS × P/E is algebraically the same as P = EPS/(1/PE) = EPS × (1/ρ_k). MM and the EPS paradigm agree on the pricing MODEL — they disagree on what determines ρ_k (MM: equilibrium in capital markets; EPS paradigm: comps) and on whether ρ_k adjusts for leverage (MM: no, it's constant within risk class; EPS paradigm: not fully or quickly).</p>
<h3>3. The Numerical Example on p. 291 Is the Core Disagreement</h3>
<p>MM show that a firm should accept a 12% project financed by equity even though the earnings yield on common equity is 16% — because the cut-off is ρ_k = 10%, not the equity yield. EPS falls from $0.80 to $0.796, but the stock price rises from $5.00 to $5.02. The EPS paradigm says: (a) in practice, the P/E multiple does not adjust for the leverage change, so the stock price falls with EPS; (b) managers are evaluated on EPS, not stock price, so they use 16% (the earnings yield) as the hurdle rate and reject the 12% project. This one example encapsulates the entire research program.</p>
<h3>4. Footnote 52 Acknowledges the EPS Dilution Problem</h3>
<p>MM write: managers &quot;may actually prefer to pass up an otherwise profitable venture rather than give outsiders an 'excessive' share of the business.&quot; This IS the EPS dilution concern — managers reject positive-NPV projects because equity financing dilutes EPS. MM dismiss it as relevant only for small/new firms. Graham &amp; Harvey (2001) later find that 68.6% of CFOs cite EPS dilution as the #1 factor in equity issuance decisions. MM's footnote was prescient but its significance was buried.</p>
<h3>5. The &quot;Traditional View&quot; That MM Critique IS the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>MM explicitly argue against the view (Graham &amp; Dodd's Eq. 14) that the market capitalizes earnings at a constant rate regardless of leverage. They call this the &quot;current doctrines&quot; or &quot;traditional view.&quot; But this traditional view — that the P/E is determined by comps and doesn't adjust mechanically for leverage — is exactly what the EPS paradigm assumes. The entire profession followed MM in rejecting the traditional view; the EPS paradigm proposes that practitioners never actually abandoned it.</p>
<h3>6. The Butter Fat Analogy and Its Limits</h3>
<p>MM's brilliant analogy — splitting milk into cream and skim doesn't change total value — works perfectly in perfect markets. But in practice, cream sells at a premium precisely BECAUSE of market segmentation, transaction costs, and different buyer preferences. Similarly, the EPS paradigm argues that the &quot;cream&quot; (equity) and &quot;skim&quot; (debt) are priced in segmented markets where the earnings yield on equity and the interest rate on debt are determined by different processes (comps vs. bond markets), not by arbitrage.</p>
<h3>7. Proposition III vs. the EPS Hurdle Rate</h3>
<p>MM's Proposition III says the cut-off rate for investment is ρ_k (the overall capitalization rate, ~10%) regardless of financing. The EPS paradigm says the cut-off rate DEPENDS on financing: for equity-financed projects, the hurdle is the earnings yield (16% in MM's example); for debt-financed projects, the hurdle is the after-tax borrowing rate (perhaps 2-4%). This creates the capital budgeting distortion: EPS-maximizing managers over-invest with debt (accept projects yielding more than the low borrowing rate) and under-invest with equity (reject projects yielding less than the high earnings yield), even when ρ_k lies between the two.</p>
<h3>8. The Tax Section Shows Equity Is &quot;Only 25% More Expensive&quot; Than Debt</h3>
<p>MM emphasize that with proper accounting for leverage effects on equity risk, equity is only 25% more expensive than debt — not 5x as the traditional view implies. This is correct in their framework. But the EPS paradigm observes that practitioners routinely perceive equity as 3-5x more expensive than debt (because they compare the earnings yield to the borrowing rate), and this perception drives real decisions. MM's &quot;correction&quot; was accepted in academia but not in practice.</p>
<h3>9. The Empirical Evidence Was Thin but Directionally Correct</h3>
<p>MM had only two studies (Allen's 43 utilities, Smith's 42 oil companies). The flat relationship between cost of capital and leverage (r = 0.04 to 0.12) supported Proposition I, while the positive relationship between equity yield and leverage (r = 0.53) supported Proposition II. The evidence was acknowledged as &quot;amazingly skimpy&quot; and &quot;very crude.&quot; Yet on this thin empirical base, the entire edifice of modern corporate finance was built.</p>
<h3>10. MM Set the Stage for All Subsequent Capital Structure Theories</h3>
<p>Every subsequent theory — trade-off (Kraus &amp; Litzenberger 1973), pecking order (Myers 1984), free cash flow (Jensen 1986), market timing (Baker &amp; Wurgler 2002) — starts from MM irrelevance and adds frictions. The EPS paradigm is different: it doesn't start from MM and add a friction. It starts from the pre-MM tradition and says MM's irrelevance was an academic innovation that practitioners never adopted. This makes the EPS paradigm fundamentally different from all post-MM theories.</p>

<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — <em>The Theory of Investment Value</em>. Cited in MM's references. Williams's present-value approach influenced MM's valuation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1952)</strong> — &quot;Costs of Debt and Equity Funds for Business.&quot; Presented both the net income approach (traditional view) and net operating income approach (MM view) as alternatives. MM cite Durand's challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — &quot;Distribution of Incomes.&quot; Cited in MM's references. MM note (Section II.B) the &quot;possible influence of the dividend pay-out ratio&quot; but defer treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — &quot;Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares.&quot; The sequel, extending MM to show dividend irrelevance under perfect markets.</li>
<li><strong>Miller (1977)</strong> — &quot;Debt and Taxes.&quot; Miller's personal-tax equilibrium model, extending MM to incorporate personal taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — &quot;The Capital Structure Puzzle.&quot; Organized the entire post-MM debate as trade-off vs. pecking order. Both theories start from MM irrelevance.</li>
<li><strong>Jensen (1986)</strong> — &quot;Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow.&quot; A third post-MM theory: debt as a control device. Also starts from MM irrelevance.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (2002)</strong> — &quot;Testing Trade-Off and Pecking Order Predictions.&quot; The negative profitability-leverage relation that challenges all post-MM theories. In the EPS paradigm, profitable firms have lower leverage because high EPS reduces the need for debt-financed buybacks.</li>
<li><strong>Frank &amp; Goyal (2009)</strong> — &quot;Capital Structure Decisions: Which Factors Are Reliably Important?&quot; The six core leverage factors, with profitability as the sole factor inconsistent with trade-off theory.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Harvey (2001)</strong> — &quot;The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance.&quot; Survey evidence that 68.6% of CFOs cite EPS dilution as the primary factor in equity issuance — exactly the concern MM dismissed in footnote 52.</li>
<li><strong>Collins &amp; Kothari (1989)</strong> — &quot;Determinants of Earnings Response Coefficients.&quot; Show that the ERC (= 1/R for random walk earnings) varies with risk, growth, persistence, and interest rates — confirming that the market's capitalization rate varies across firms, as MM's risk-class framework predicts.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — MM (1958) is the foundational paper for the entire EPS research program. The capital structure predictions in the EPS paper — leverage increases when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing cost — follow directly from rejecting MM's Proposition I (that total value is independent of leverage) and instead assuming P/E is determined by comps. The numerical example on p. 291 is the paper's central counterargument.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — MM (1958) is the intellectual watershed: the paper that changed corporate finance from EPS maximization to value maximization. The maxEPS paradigm paper must document how this happened, why academics followed MM but practitioners did not, and what was lost in the transition.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — Proposition III says the cut-off rate is ρ_k regardless of financing. The EPS paradigm says the effective cut-off depends on financing (earnings yield for equity, borrowing rate for debt). This creates the EPS capital budgeting distortion — the central topic of the capital budgeting paper.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — MM's ρ_k = X̄/V is the earnings yield. In the EPS paradigm, the equity risk premium is the earnings yield minus the risk-free rate. MM would agree with this arithmetic but disagree about what determines ρ_k.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — MM's framework is fundamentally backward-looking: ρ_k is the capitalization rate applied to CURRENT expected earnings, not a discount rate applied to future cash flows. In this sense, MM (1958) is closer to the EPS paradigm than to modern DCF valuation.</li>
