    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Basu's 1983 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper (McMaster University Working Paper No. 180, September 1981) disentangles the E/P effect from the size effect using a novel randomized portfolio methodology. Using approximately 900 NYSE firms over 1962-1978, Basu forms five portfolios sorted by E/P ratio and five sorted by market value (size), then creates randomized control portfolios that match on one variable while randomizing across the other. The central finding is devastating for the size-effect literature: the E/P effect is primary and the size effect is secondary. When E/P is controlled, the size effect virtually disappears (Hotelling T² F = 0.61, not significant). When size is controlled, the E/P effect remains highly significant (Hotelling T² F = 4.85, p &lt; 0.01). The paper concludes that &quot;the effect of differences in market value or size on common stock returns is of secondary importance when compared with the effect of E/P ratios.&quot; For the EPS project, this is the definitive demonstration that the earnings yield — not firm size — is the fundamental cross-sectional predictor of stock returns.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Motivation: E/P vs. Size (pp. 1-3 of WP)</h3>
<p>By 1981, two cross-sectional return anomalies had been documented:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The E/P effect</strong> (Basu 1977): Low P/E stocks earn higher risk-adjusted returns than high P/E stocks</li>
<li><strong>The size effect</strong> (Banz 1981): Small firms earn higher returns than large firms</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem: E/P and size are negatively correlated — small firms tend to have high E/P (low P/E) and large firms tend to have low E/P (high P/E). So which variable actually drives the cross-sectional return pattern? Are high E/P stocks outperforming because they have high earnings yields, or simply because they tend to be small?</p>
<p>Reinganum (1981) claimed that E/P has no additional explanatory power beyond size. Basu challenges this directly.</p>
<h3>Data and Methodology (pp. 3-7)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> All NYSE common stocks with December fiscal year-end, positive earnings, and continuous data, yielding approximately 900 firms per year over April 1963 to March 1979 (fiscal years 1962-1978, 17 years).</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio construction (April 1 each year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>E/P portfolios (EP1-EP5):</strong> Firms ranked by E/P ratio (earnings yield = EPS/price as of December 31). EP1 = lowest E/P (highest P/E), EP5 = highest E/P (lowest P/E).</li>
<li><strong>Size portfolios (MV1-MV5):</strong> Firms ranked by market value (price × shares outstanding as of December 31). MV1 = smallest, MV5 = largest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The randomized portfolio innovation:</strong> To isolate the E/P effect from size (and vice versa), Basu constructs randomized control portfolios:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>EP1</em>-EP5</em>:** Start with the E/P ranking, then within each E/P quintile, randomly assign firms to portfolios that MATCH the original E/P quintile composition but RANDOMIZE across size. This controls for E/P while allowing size to vary randomly.</li>
<li><em><em>MV1</em>-MV5</em>:** Start with the size ranking, then within each size quintile, randomly assign firms to match the original size composition but randomize across E/P. This controls for size while allowing E/P to vary randomly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return measurement:</strong> Monthly returns April 1 to March 31, using CRSP data.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark:</strong> Both equal-weighted (EW) and value-weighted (VW) NYSE indices. Jensen's alpha from the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM.</p>
<p><strong>Test statistic:</strong> Hotelling's T² test for joint significance of alphas across all five portfolios — a more powerful multivariate test than examining individual t-statistics.</p>

<p>The negative association is clear: EP5 firms (highest E/P) have mean market value of $228M, while EP1 firms (lowest E/P) average $1,144M. This confounding is exactly what motivates the randomized portfolio approach.</p>

<p>Both E/P and size appear to predict returns in raw data. EP5-EP1 spread = 0.74%/month (8.9% annualized). MV1-MV5 spread = 0.86%/month (10.3% annualized). The question is which is the driving force.</p>

<p>With the VW index, all size portfolios have POSITIVE alphas (all beat the VW index), reflecting the well-known small-firm tilt of the EW vs. VW indices. But the E/P effect remains as strong as ever.</p>
<h3>The Central Conclusion (pp. 15-16)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the effect of differences in market value or size on common stock returns is of secondary importance when compared with the effect of E/P ratios&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basu further notes: &quot;the common stock portfolio returns actually earned by these investors were, on average, commensurate with the risk levels of those portfolios as measured by their beta coefficients&quot; for the randomized size portfolios — meaning the size effect is entirely explained by beta once E/P is controlled.</p>
<p>The E/P effect, by contrast, survives all controls and represents a genuine cross-sectional return predictor that cannot be explained by CAPM beta.</p>
<h3>The Reinganum Critique Refuted (pp. 14-16)</h3>
<p>Reinganum (1981) had argued that E/P has no effect beyond size. Basu shows this conclusion was driven by Reinganum's methodology: Reinganum used quarterly E/P updates (creating survivorship and look-ahead bias) and did not properly control for the confounding between E/P and size. With the randomized portfolio approach, the opposite conclusion holds: size has no effect beyond E/P.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Earnings Yield Is the Fundamental Pricing Variable</h3>
<p>Basu (1983) provides the definitive evidence that the earnings yield (E/P) — not firm size — is the primary cross-sectional determinant of stock returns. This directly supports the EPS paradigm's core claim: the earnings yield IS the cost of equity. If E/P predicts returns after controlling for size, beta, and other variables, then E/P is doing the work of a required return — exactly as the EPS paradigm proposes.</p>
<h3>2. Size Is a Proxy for E/P, Not Vice Versa</h3>
<p>The finding that the size effect disappears when E/P is controlled reverses the conventional interpretation. Small firms earn higher returns not because they are small but because they tend to have high earnings yields. Size is a noisy proxy for the earnings yield. This matters for the EPS paradigm because it means the &quot;size premium&quot; is really an &quot;earnings yield premium&quot; — consistent with earnings-based pricing.</p>
<h3>3. Pre-Dates and Pre-Empts Fama-French</h3>
<p>Basu (1983) documents the primacy of the earnings yield over size a full decade before Fama &amp; French (1992) attribute the cross-sectional pattern to book-to-market (HML). The Fama-French framework replaces E/P with B/M as the value variable, but Basu shows E/P is the original and arguably more fundamental measure. The EPS paradigm's emphasis on the earnings yield aligns with Basu's finding more naturally than the book-to-market ratio.</p>
<h3>4. The Randomized Portfolio Methodology Is Clean</h3>
<p>Basu's randomized portfolio approach provides a cleaner test than the Fama-MacBeth regressions used by later studies. By constructing portfolios that match on one variable while randomizing the other, Basu avoids the multicollinearity problems that plague cross-sectional regressions. The result — E/P significant, size not — is therefore more reliable than results from methods that struggle to disentangle correlated variables.</p>
<h3>5. Hotelling T² vs. Individual t-Statistics</h3>
<p>Basu's use of Hotelling's T² test (a multivariate test of joint significance) is more rigorous than examining individual portfolio alphas. The fact that the E/P portfolios pass this test (F = 4.85, p &lt; 0.01) while size portfolios fail (F = 0.61) is a strong result that cannot be attributed to cherry-picking extreme portfolios.</p>
<h3>6. The Earnings Yield Spread as Cross-Sectional Return Predictor</h3>
<p>The EP5-EP1 alpha spread of approximately 0.7%/month (8.4% annualized) represents the return to investing based on the earnings yield. In the EPS paradigm, this spread exists because high E/P firms have high costs of equity (investors demand a high earnings yield to hold them), and these high required returns translate into high realized returns. The spread is not an anomaly — it is the direct manifestation of earnings-based pricing.</p>

<li><strong>Basu (1977)</strong> — Basu's earlier paper documents the P/E effect without controlling for size. Basu (1983) extends this by showing the E/P effect is robust to — and indeed subsumes — the size effect.</li>
<li><strong>Banz (1981)</strong> — &quot;The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks.&quot; Documents the size effect. Basu (1983) shows this effect is secondary to E/P.</li>
<li><strong>Reinganum (1981)</strong> — &quot;Misspecification of Capital Asset Pricing: Empirical Anomalies Based on Earnings' Yields and Market Values.&quot; Claims E/P has no effect beyond size. Basu (1983) directly refutes this.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (1992)</strong> — &quot;The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns.&quot; Replaces E/P with book-to-market as the value variable. Basu's results suggest E/P may be the more fundamental measure.</li>
<li><strong>Jaffe, Keim &amp; Westerfield (1989)</strong> — &quot;Earnings Yields, Market Values and Stock Returns&quot; confirms Basu's finding that E/P dominates size in predicting returns.</li>
<li><strong>Ball (1978)</strong> — &quot;Anomalies in Relationships Between Securities' Yields and Yield-Surrogates.&quot; Argues anomalies like the P/E effect may reflect misspecification of the asset pricing model rather than market inefficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1965)</strong> — Lintner's CAPM implies company-specific required returns. Basu shows that the earnings yield captures these required returns better than beta alone.</li>
<li><strong>Black, Jensen &amp; Scholes (1972)</strong> — The CAPM benchmark that Basu uses. The failure of beta to explain E/P-sorted returns undermines the CAPM and supports earnings-based pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</strong> — Graham &amp; Dodd's value investing uses the earnings yield as the key metric. Basu (1983) shows this metric predicts returns — validating the Graham-Dodd approach empirically.</li>
<li><strong>Ou &amp; Penman (1989)</strong> — Document the P/E effect alongside the Pr measure. Basu's finding that E/P is primary supports Ou &amp; Penman's framework treating P/E as an earnings capitalization multiplier.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Basu (1983) is the definitive empirical support for the EPS paradigm's claim that the earnings yield is the cost of equity. The earnings yield predicts returns, dominates size, and survives beta controls. No other single variable does this as cleanly.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — Basu uses backward-looking E/P (last year's earnings / current price) to predict forward returns. This is backward-looking asset pricing in its purest form: current earnings determine expected returns.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — The E/P spread across portfolios (EP5 ≈ 14% vs. EP1 ≈ 3%) maps directly onto the equity risk premium. In the EPS paradigm, the ERP is simply the observable earnings yield minus the risk-free rate. Basu shows that this observable spread predicts realized returns.</li>
