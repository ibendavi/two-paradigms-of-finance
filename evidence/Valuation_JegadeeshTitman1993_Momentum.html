    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Jegadeesh &amp; Titman's 1993 JF paper documents the <strong>momentum anomaly</strong>: trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers generate significant abnormal returns over <strong>3-12 month horizons</strong>. The most detailed strategy examined — selecting stocks based on 6-month past returns and holding for 6 months — yields a <strong>compounded excess return of 12.01% per year</strong> (about 1% per month). These profits are NOT due to systematic risk (betas of zero-cost portfolios are negative), NOT due to lead-lag effects from delayed reactions to common factors, and survive after transaction costs (~9.29%/year net). The profits are mainly attributable to the market's delayed reaction to <strong>firm-specific information</strong>. Crucially, about half the excess returns dissipate within 12 months after the holding period, suggesting the momentum is <strong>partly temporary</strong> — prices overshoot and then partially reverse. Combined with De Bondt &amp; Thaler's (1985) long-term reversal, this creates the fundamental puzzle of asset pricing: short-term continuation coexisting with long-term reversal.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Motivation and Strategy Design (pp. 65-68)</h3>
<p>Prior evidence (Lo &amp; MacKinlay 1990) showed positive serial correlation in weekly returns, and De Bondt &amp; Thaler (1985) documented long-term reversal. This paper examines the <strong>intermediate horizon</strong> (3-12 months) — the gap between short-term microstructure effects and long-term reversal.</p>
<p><strong>Trading strategies tested:</strong> 32 strategies varying:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>J</strong> = formation period: 3, 6, 9, or 12 months (rank stocks by past J-month return)</li>
<li><strong>K</strong> = holding period: 3, 6, 9, or 12 months (hold the portfolio for K months)</li>
<li>Stocks ranked into deciles; buy top decile (winners), sell bottom decile (losers)</li>
<li><strong>One-week skip</strong> between formation and holding periods to avoid bid-ask bounce and short-term reversal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> NYSE and AMEX stocks, 1965-1989.</p>
<h3>The Key Results: Table I (pp. 68-70)</h3>

</table>
<p><strong>All 32 strategies are profitable.</strong> The t-statistics are all significant (ranging from ~2.5 to over 4.0). The best single strategy: 12-month formation, 3-month holding → 1.49%/month.</p>
<p>The most analyzed strategy: <strong>6-month/6-month → 1.09%/month ≈ 12.01% per year compounded.</strong></p>
<h3>Not Explained by Risk (pp. 70-73)</h3>
<p><strong>CAPM beta:</strong> The zero-cost (winner minus loser) portfolio has a <strong>negative beta</strong> (about -0.08). Since the portfolio earns positive returns with negative beta, the abnormal returns are even LARGER after risk adjustment than the raw returns. Beta cannot explain momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> The winner portfolio has slightly larger average market cap than the loser portfolio, but the spread is not driven by size. When the strategy is implemented within size subsamples (small, medium, large), it remains profitable in all groups.</p>
<h3>Decomposition of Profits (pp. 71-74)</h3>
<p>The paper decomposes momentum profits into three sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E{(r_it - r̄_t)(r_{it-1} - r̄_{t-1})} = σ²_μ + δσ²_f</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-sectional dispersion in expected returns (σ²_μ):</strong> If stocks have different unconditional expected returns, momentum strategies mechanically profit from this dispersion. But this would produce PERMANENT excess returns, not the temporary ones observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Factor serial covariance (related to δ):</strong> If common factors are serially correlated and stocks react to them with a lag (lead-lag effect). Tested and rejected — see below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firm-specific serial covariance:</strong> If individual stock returns are positively autocorrelated due to delayed reaction to firm-specific information. <strong>This is the main source.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence: The serial covariance of market model residuals for individual stocks is <strong>positive on average (0.0012)</strong>, indicating firm-specific underreaction.</p>
<h3>Lead-Lag Effects Rejected (pp. 74-76)</h3>
<p>A key alternative: momentum profits could arise from &quot;lead-lag&quot; effects where some stocks react to common factors faster than others (Lo &amp; MacKinlay 1990).</p>
<p>Test: Regress momentum portfolio returns on squared lagged market returns. If lead-lag effects drive profits, the coefficient should be positive. Result: the coefficient θ is <strong>negative</strong> (-2.29, t = -1.74 for full sample) — the lead-lag model is rejected. &quot;The lead-lag effect is not an important source of relative strength profits.&quot;</p>
<h3>Profitability Within Subsamples (Table III, pp. 76-79)</h3>
<p><strong>Size subsamples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small firms: 0.82%/month (t = 1.63)</li>
<li>Medium firms: 1.15%/month (t = 1.57)</li>
<li>Large firms: 1.46%/month (t = 2.89)</li>
</ul>
<p>Momentum is actually STRONGEST among large firms — the opposite of what a microstructure/friction explanation would predict.</p>
<p><strong>Beta subsamples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low beta: 1.53%/month (t = 2.61)</li>
<li>Medium beta: 1.33%/month (t = 2.61)</li>
<li>High beta: 1.97%/month (t = 2.89)</li>
</ul>
<p>Profits exist in all beta groups. Monotonically increasing in beta in the full sample.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-adjusted returns (Panel B):</strong> Using market model regression intercepts (alphas), the abnormal returns are similar to or slightly higher than raw returns (consistent with the negative betas of zero-cost portfolios).</p>
<h3>After Transaction Costs (p. 77)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Average turnover: ~84.8% semiannually</li>
<li>Assuming 0.5% one-way transaction costs (Berkowitz, Logue &amp; Noser 1988)</li>
<li><strong>Net return: 9.29% per year</strong> — still &quot;reliably different from zero&quot;</li>
<li>Profitable after transaction costs in each size subsample</li>
</ul>
<h3>Seasonal Patterns (Tables IV-V, pp. 78-81)</h3>
<p><strong>The January Anomaly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The relative strength strategy <strong>loses about 7% in January</strong> on average</li>
<li>Positive in 67% of all months, but only 24% of Januaries</li>
<li>Excluding January: positive in 71% of months, average return 1.66%/month</li>
<li>The January loss is <strong>inversely related to firm size</strong> (largest for small firms)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the mirror image of De Bondt &amp; Thaler (1985): long-term losers earn huge January returns, while momentum losers (recent losers being shorted) also earn January returns, hurting the momentum strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Strongest months:</strong> April (3.33%), June, November, December — possible tax and window-dressing effects.</p>
<h3>Subperiod Stability (Table VI, p. 82)</h3>
<p>Five-year subperiods (1965-1989):</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive in 4 out of 5 subperiods (All stocks)</li>
<li>Negative only in 1975-1979, driven by small-firm January returns</li>
<li>Excluding January: positive in all five subperiods</li>
<li>Robust across time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Event-Time Analysis: The Partial Reversal (Table VII, pp. 83-84)</h3>
<p><strong>The most important finding for understanding the anomaly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Track the zero-cost portfolio's returns for 36 months after formation</li>
<li>Months 1-12: positive returns in almost every month (cumulative: +9.5%)</li>
<li>Months 13-36: <strong>negative returns</strong> — the gains partially dissipate</li>
<li>By month 36: cumulative return declines to about 4%</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;The negative returns beyond month 12 indicate that the relative strength strategy does not tend to pick stocks that have high unconditional expected returns.&quot; The initial momentum is <strong>partly temporary</strong> — prices overshoot and then partially reverse.</p>
<p>Beta of the zero-cost portfolio starts at -0.20 and rises to -0.02 over time — risk changes go in the WRONG direction to explain the return pattern (risk decreases while returns go negative).</p>
<h3>Earnings Announcement Evidence (Table IX, pp. 86-89)</h3>
<p><strong>The smoking gun for underreaction to firm-specific information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Examine 3-day returns around quarterly earnings announcements for winner and loser deciles</li>
<li>Months 1-7 after formation: winners' announcement returns <strong>exceed</strong> losers' by 0.55-0.90% per announcement (t-stats 2.75-4.88)</li>
<li>Months 8-20: the pattern <strong>reverses</strong> — losers' announcement returns exceed winners'</li>
<li>&quot;Returns around earnings announcements represents about 25% of the zero-cost portfolio returns over this holding period&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This confirms the underreaction interpretation: the market initially underreacts to positive earnings surprises (winners keep surprising positively) and negative surprises (losers keep surprising negatively). Later, the effect reverses as the information is fully incorporated.</p>
<h3>Back-Testing Pre-1965 (Table VIII, pp. 85-87)</h3>
<p><strong>1927-1940:</strong> Momentum strategy has strongly NEGATIVE returns (cumulative -40.81% over 36 months). This period featured extreme mean reversion (Great Depression volatility). The strategy's beta was about -0.5, and large market reversals devastated the long-winners/short-losers position.</p>
<p><strong>1941-1964:</strong> Pattern similar to 1965-1989 — positive in months 2-12, negative thereafter. More stable period.</p>
<h3>Conclusions (pp. 89-90)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers realize significant abnormal returns over the 1965 to 1989 period.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence suggests two coexisting phenomena:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short-term underreaction</strong> to firm-specific information → momentum (months 1-12)</li>
<li><strong>Longer-term overreaction</strong> or temporary price pressure → reversal (months 13-36)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Common interpretations of return reversals as evidence of overreaction and return persistence (i.e., past winners achieving positive returns in the future) as evidence of underreaction are probably overly simplistic.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interpretation: momentum traders who buy past winners and sell past losers &quot;temporarily move prices away from their long-run values&quot; — consistent with DeLong, Shleifer, Summers &amp; Waldman (1990) positive feedback trading.</p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Momentum Anomaly Established</h3>
<p>Jegadeesh &amp; Titman (1993) established momentum as one of the most robust anomalies in finance. It has since been documented across countries, asset classes, and time periods. Carhart (1997) added a momentum factor (WML or UMD) to the Fama-French three-factor model, creating the four-factor model that became the standard benchmark.</p>
<h3>2. The Short-Term/Long-Term Puzzle</h3>
<p>The coexistence of short-term momentum (3-12 months) and long-term reversal (3-5 years, per De Bondt &amp; Thaler 1985) is one of the deepest puzzles in asset pricing. No single model — rational or behavioral — fully explains both. This dual pattern implies the market both underreacts to new information in the short term AND overreacts in the long term.</p>
<h3>3. Fama's &quot;Biggest Embarrassment&quot;</h3>
<p>Fama (1998) called momentum &quot;the premier anomaly&quot; — the one cross-sectional pattern that could not be easily explained by risk-based models. Unlike the value premium (which Fama-French 1993 attributes to distress risk), momentum has no clean rational explanation. It remains the strongest evidence against efficient markets in the cross-section.</p>
<h3>4. Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift Connection</h3>
<p>The earnings announcement evidence (Table IX) directly connects momentum to post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) — documented by Bernard &amp; Thomas (1990). Both reflect the market's failure to fully incorporate earnings information immediately. Together, momentum and PEAD suggest the market systematically underreacts to firm-specific fundamental news.</p>
<h3>5. Transaction Costs and Implementability</h3>
<p>Unlike many anomalies that disappear after transaction costs, momentum survives with a net return of ~9.3%/year. This made it commercially important — momentum-based strategies became a major factor in quantitative investing and &quot;smart beta&quot; products.</p>
<h3>6. The Partial Reversal — Not Pure Momentum</h3>
<p>The finding that half of momentum returns dissipate within 2 years is crucial. It means momentum is NOT simply that certain stocks have permanently higher expected returns. The returns are partly temporary, consistent with behavioral explanations (initial underreaction followed by correction or overreaction). This distinguishes momentum from rational risk-based explanations.</p>
