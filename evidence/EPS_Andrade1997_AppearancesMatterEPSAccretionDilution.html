    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Andrade's 1997 Harvard Business School working paper provides the first direct evidence that EPS accretion and dilution in mergers affect acquirer stock prices. Using 4,814 mergers from 1975-1994, Andrade computes two measures of EPS accretion — MKT_ACC (market accretion, what the deal would deliver at market prices without a premium) and ACQ_ACC (acquisition accretion, what the deal actually delivers at the terms paid) — and shows both significantly predict acquirer announcement returns and long-term abnormal performance. The announcement-return coefficient on accretion is approximately 0.3, implying a &quot;three-to-one&quot; relationship: a 1% change in the acquirer's earnings yield from the deal produces roughly a 0.3% return. Long-term abnormal returns over 18 months also increase with accretion, at roughly 0.1% per month (1.3% annualized), with the effect concentrated in dilutive deals and firms with low institutional ownership. Critically, EPS accretion is uncorrelated with changes in actual operating cash flows — the effect is purely cosmetic (accounting-driven), yet the market responds. Pooling accretion (which is entirely an accounting artifact — the target's book value is substituted for the purchase price) has the same magnitude and significance as purchase accretion, further confirming the cosmetic nature. The market response is roughly one-tenth of what a &quot;naive practitioner view&quot; (coefficient of 10) would predict — investors partially but not fully see through EPS accretion. For the EPS project, this is the earliest paper directly testing the M&amp;A EPS accretion mechanism and finding that appearances DO matter: cosmetic EPS changes from mergers move stock prices, exactly as the EPS paradigm predicts.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 1-5)</h3>
<p><strong>The central question:</strong> Practitioners universally evaluate mergers based on whether the deal is EPS-accretive or EPS-dilutive to the acquirer. Does this cosmetic accounting metric actually affect stock prices?</p>
<p><strong>The practitioner view:</strong> Investment bankers and corporate managers treat EPS accretion as a primary criterion for deal evaluation. A deal that is EPS-accretive is viewed favorably; an EPS-dilutive deal must be &quot;justified&quot; by future growth. The naive practitioner prediction: a 1% increase in the acquirer's earnings yield from the deal should produce a return equal to the inverse of the P/E ratio × the change — roughly a coefficient of 10 on the accretion variable.</p>
<p><strong>The academic view:</strong> In efficient markets, cosmetic EPS changes should not affect value. Only changes in real cash flows should matter. EPS accretion is a mechanical result of combining two earnings streams at different multiples — no real value is created.</p>
<p><strong>Two accretion measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MKT_ACC (market accretion):</strong> The hypothetical EPS accretion if the acquirer could buy the target at market prices (no premium). Computed as: [(E_T/P_T) - (E_A/P_A)] × relative size. This measures the raw earnings yield differential between target and acquirer.</li>
<li><strong>ACQ_ACC (acquisition accretion):</strong> The actual EPS accretion at the deal's terms (including premium paid). Computed using the actual exchange ratio or deal value. This is what the acquirer actually delivers to shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 2: Data and Methodology (pp. 5-12)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 4,814 mergers from SDC, 1975-1994. Includes stock deals, cash deals, and mixed payment. For EPS accretion to be computable, both acquirer and target must have earnings data.</p>
<p><strong>Key variable construction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earnings yield = (Net income before extraordinary items + interest expense × (1-tax rate)) / market cap</li>
<li>MKT_ACC = (target earnings yield - acquirer earnings yield) × (target market cap / acquirer market cap)</li>
<li>ACQ_ACC = same formula but using actual deal value instead of target market cap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary statistics:</strong> Mean MKT_ACC = 0.82% (median 0.36%); mean ACQ_ACC = -0.06% (median -0.28%). The premium converts most accretive deals (at market prices) into dilutive deals (at acquisition terms). But substantial variation exists in both directions.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Announcement Returns (pp. 12-20)</h3>
<p><strong>Main results — Table 3:</strong></p>
<p>Cross-sectional regressions of acquirer 3-day announcement CARs on accretion measures:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Coefficient</th>
<th>t-stat</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MKT_ACC</td>
<td>~0.3</td>
<td>significant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACQ_ACC</td>
<td>~0.3</td>
<td>significant</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>The &quot;three-to-one&quot; relationship:</strong> A coefficient of 0.3 means that for every 1 percentage point increase in the acquirer's earnings yield from the deal, the announcement return increases by approximately 0.3%. If the naive practitioner view were correct (market fully capitalizes EPS accretion), the coefficient would be approximately 10 (the P/E ratio). The actual coefficient of 0.3 is roughly one-tenth of this.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The market does respond to EPS accretion, but partially — it does not fully capitalize the cosmetic EPS change. Roughly 3% of the EPS accretion &quot;leaks through&quot; into stock prices.</p>
<p>Controls: Results hold after controlling for deal size, payment method, industry relatedness, hostile vs. friendly, and year fixed effects.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Long-Term Abnormal Returns (pp. 20-26)</h3>
<p><strong>Calendar-time portfolio regressions (Fama-French approach):</strong></p>
<p>Portfolios sorted by ACQ_ACC (accretive vs. dilutive deals) are held for 18 months post-announcement. The coefficient on accretion in monthly return regressions is approximately 0.1% per month, or roughly 1.3% annualized.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The positive relation between accretion and long-term returns is concentrated in the <strong>first 18 months</strong> after the deal</li>
<li>The effect is stronger for <strong>dilutive deals</strong> — the market penalizes dilutive deals more than it rewards accretive ones</li>
<li>The effect is stronger for firms with <strong>low institutional ownership</strong> — consistent with less sophisticated investors driving the EPS accretion response</li>
<li>The effect is economically meaningful but far smaller than the naive practitioner prediction</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 5: Pooling vs. Purchase Accounting (pp. 26-30)</h3>
<p><strong>This section is critical for the EPS paradigm.</strong></p>
<p>Under pooling accounting (pre-2001), the acquirer records the target's assets at book value. Under purchase accounting, assets are recorded at fair (purchase) value and any excess is goodwill, which was then amortized against earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Pooling accretion is PURELY cosmetic:</strong> It arises solely because the target's book value (used in pooling) differs from its market value. There is no economic difference between a pooling and purchase deal — the same assets, same cash flows, same business combination. The only difference is the accounting treatment of the target's book value and goodwill.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Pooling accretion has the SAME magnitude and significance as purchase accretion in predicting announcement returns and long-term performance. The market responds equally to a purely accounting-driven EPS change as to one that reflects actual earnings yield differentials.</p>
<p>This is powerful evidence that appearances DO matter: an EPS change that is entirely an accounting artifact moves stock prices.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Operating Performance (pp. 30-33)</h3>
<p><strong>The acid test:</strong> If EPS accretion reflected real economic value creation, it should predict changes in operating cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> EPS accretion is UNCORRELATED with changes in operating performance (cash flow from operations, EBITDA). Accretive deals do NOT produce better operating outcomes than dilutive deals.</p>
<p>This confirms that EPS accretion is cosmetic — it does not reflect real value creation. Yet the market responds to it (Sections 3-4). This combination — cosmetic metric, real price impact — is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts.</p>
<h3>Section 7: Summary (pp. 33-35)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrade concludes that &quot;appearances matter&quot; — EPS accretion affects stock prices even though it provides no information about real economic value. The effect is partial: roughly one-tenth of what a naive view would predict, suggesting the market partially but not fully sees through cosmetic EPS changes.</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. First Direct Test of EPS Accretion in M&amp;A</h3>
<p>This is the earliest paper to directly test whether the practitioner obsession with EPS accretion/dilution in mergers has a real stock price effect. It confirms that the EPS accretion criterion — the same criterion investment bankers use to evaluate every deal — is reflected in market prices. This is foundational evidence for the EPS paradigm's M&amp;A predictions.</p>
<h3>2. Appearances DO Matter — Cosmetic EPS Moves Prices</h3>
<p>The combination of three findings — (a) EPS accretion predicts announcement returns, (b) EPS accretion is uncorrelated with operating performance, and (c) pooling accretion (purely accounting-driven) has the same effect as purchase accretion — proves that cosmetic EPS changes move stock prices. In the NPV paradigm, this should not happen. In the EPS paradigm, it is expected: P = EPS × P/E, so anything that changes reported EPS changes price.</p>
<h3>3. The Market Partially Capitalizes EPS Accretion</h3>
<p>The coefficient of 0.3 (vs. ~10 for full capitalization) means the market is somewhere between fully seeing through EPS accretion (coefficient = 0) and fully capitalizing it (coefficient ≈ 10). This partial response is consistent with the EPS paradigm: the market uses EPS in pricing but is not entirely naive — some investors recognize the cosmetic nature. The &quot;truth&quot; lies between the NPV paradigm's prediction (zero response) and the naive EPS paradigm's prediction (full capitalization).</p>
<h3>4. Low Institutional Ownership Amplifies the Effect</h3>
<p>The finding that low institutional ownership firms show stronger EPS accretion effects suggests that less sophisticated investors are more responsive to EPS-based metrics. This connects to the EPS paradigm's claim that earnings capitalization is the default pricing mechanism — more prevalent among retail and less analytically sophisticated investors.</p>
<h3>5. Pooling Accretion Confirms the Accounting Channel</h3>
<p>Pooling accretion is a perfect test case: it is 100% accounting artifact, zero economic substance. The fact that the market responds to pooling accretion identically to purchase accretion is perhaps the single strongest piece of evidence that reported EPS — not economic value — drives pricing. This directly supports P = EPS × P/E.</p>
<h3>6. The One-Tenth Ratio Matches Hribar et al.'s Partial Discounting</h3>
<p>Andrade's finding that the market response is ~1/10 of the naive prediction parallels Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson's (2006) finding that the market partially discounts repurchase-induced EPS. Both papers find the same pattern: the market responds to cosmetic EPS changes but at a fraction of the full-capitalization rate. The EPS paradigm accommodates this: P = EPS × P/E, but the implicit P/E applied to cosmetic EPS may be lower than the P/E applied to organic EPS.</p>
<h3>7. Dilutive Deals Are Penalized More Than Accretive Deals Are Rewarded</h3>
<p>The asymmetry — stronger effects for dilutive deals — is consistent with the practitioner world's asymmetric treatment of accretion and dilution. An EPS-dilutive deal requires extensive justification (&quot;it will be accretive in year 3&quot;); an accretive deal is presumed good. This asymmetric hurdle is exactly what the EPS paradigm describes.</p>
