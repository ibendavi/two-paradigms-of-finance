    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Mead's 1910 Wharton textbook — one of the earliest American corporate finance textbooks (Greene's <em>Corporation Finance</em> appeared in 1902) — contains NO valuation formula, NO present value, NO Fisher reference, and NO concept of a &quot;correct&quot; stock price. &quot;Capitalized earning power&quot; is used informally by promoters, but never defined mathematically. Stock value = a function of dividend stability: &quot;Corporations exist and do business to produce dividends for their owners.&quot; This is the pre-theoretical baseline: before Dewing (1920), before Gerstenberg (1924), before Graham &amp; Dodd (1934). Corporate finance in 1910 was a descriptive account of financial practice — sophisticated about human psychology and accounting, but entirely devoid of the analytical tools Fisher (1907) had already developed three years earlier, 100 miles away at Yale.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>&quot;Capitalized Earning Power&quot; — Used but Never Defined (Ch. III, pp. 39-46)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The promoter... addresses himself to the second part of his task — to secure options upon the separate plants at a figure less than <strong>the capitalized earning power</strong> of the combination he proposes to form, which difference will represent his profit.&quot; (p. 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The common stock represented the capitalized value of the economies of combination.&quot; (p. 147)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept exists — promoters use &quot;capitalized earning power&quot; as working shorthand — but Mead never writes V = E/r, never specifies a capitalization rate, never says &quot;multiply by 10&quot; or &quot;divide by 10%.&quot; The term is intuitive, not mathematical.</p>
<h3>Stock Value = Dividend Stability (Ch. XVI, p. 210-211)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The stockholder desires a stable dividend because the value of a stock whose dividends, for example, run six, six, two, two, and four, averaging four per cent for the five years, but irregularly distributed, <strong>will command a lower price than stock on which four per cent is paid every year</strong>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The payment of regular dividends produces a higher and more stable value for such stocks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Corporations exist and do business to produce dividends for their owners.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Mead's central principle: stock value is about dividend stability, not about a calculable fundamental worth.</p>
<h3>Investment vs. Speculation: Information, Not Time Horizon (Ch. X, p. 126)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The distinguishing characteristic of a speculation is the fact that its value depends upon circumstances which cannot be known because the future is intended to reveal them. An investment on the other hand contains no 'ifs' or 'provideds' or 'believes,' <strong>its value is founded upon certainty</strong>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mead's distinction is epistemological: investment = known value; speculation = unknown. This is sharper than Aubrey (1896) but less operational than Graham &amp; Dodd (1934).</p>
<h3>The 1900 Wall Street Journal Checklist (pp. 132-133)</h3>
<p>Mead reproduces a 13-question evaluation framework for trust stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past earnings (5-year average)</li>
<li>Earnings as percentage of par value</li>
<li>Expense ratios, competition, management quality</li>
<li><strong>No present value, no capitalization rate, no valuation formula</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is pure ratio analysis and qualitative judgment — the practitioner toolkit of 1900.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Finance Avant la Lettre (Ch. XI-XII, pp. 137-156)</h3>
<p>Remarkable psychological sophistication:</p>
<p><strong>Cupidity and imagination</strong> (p. 137, 140):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first step in the process of selling stock to a speculative buyer is to excite his imagination.&quot;
&quot;Cupidity is the next passion to which the promoter appeals.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Overconfidence and neglect of risk</strong> (p. 143):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The speculator does not buy a chance, he buys what he thinks is a fortune.&quot;
&quot;He has forsaken the difficult paths of reason for the flowery fields of imagination and conjecture.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Momentum trading</strong> (p. 153):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The higher the stock climbs, the more eager are the speculators to purchase.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>South Sea Bubble parallel</strong> (p. 143):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The line of speculators is very ancient. In 1720 there was printed for W. Bonham, in London, 'an argument proving that the South Sea Company is able to make a dividend of thirty-eight per cent for twelve years.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Yield Calculation — Backward-Looking Only (Ch. XII, pp. 147-148)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;International Paper... represented a yield on the investment of 17.2 per cent, while the common stock of International Silver... represented a return of 31.2 per cent.&quot;
&quot;These prices, when measured by the yield on safe investments, represented extravagant returns.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mead calculates realized yields (dividend / price) but uses them only as a reasonableness check, not as a valuation tool.</p>
<h3>What Mead Did NOT Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>No V = E/r or earnings multiplier</li>
<li>No present value or DCF</li>
<li>No reference to Fisher (1907) — complete ignorance</li>
<li>No &quot;intrinsic value&quot; concept</li>
<li>No capitalization rate</li>
<li>No P/E ratio</li>
<li>No compound interest in depreciation (explicitly notes it's not used, p. 196)</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. An Early Corporate Finance Textbook Had No Valuation Theory</h3>
<p>Mead's 1910 textbook, used at Wharton — one of America's leading business schools — contained no tool for determining what a stock is worth. (Greene's 1902 textbook similarly lacked formal valuation methods.) Finance was about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create and sell securities (promotion)</li>
<li>How to measure profits correctly (accounting)</li>
<li>How to maintain dividends conservatively (management)</li>
<li>How to restructure bankrupt firms (reorganization)
It was NOT about: What is this stock worth? Should I buy or sell?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The 1910-1920 Revolution</h3>
<p>Mead (1910) → Dewing (1920) represents a critical transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mead: &quot;capitalized earning power&quot; as informal promoter concept; no formula</li>
<li>Dewing: earning power explicitly recognized as the basis for value; still no formula</li>
<li>Gerstenberg (1924): V = E/r written down explicitly for the first time in a textbook
The formalization of the earnings capitalization idea took 14 years (1910-1924).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Fisher's Invisibility Confirmed Across Early Textbooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lyon (1916 textbook, 1917 curriculum guide): no Fisher</li>
<li>Mead (1910): no Fisher</li>
<li>Dewing (1920): no Fisher
Fisher published <em>The Rate of Interest</em> in 1907. By 1920, three of the leading corporate finance textbooks showed zero trace of his influence. The theory-practice gap was absolute.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Rich Behavioral Content</h3>
<p>Mead's chapters on speculation are among the most psychologically sophisticated in our entire collection — more vivid than Crump (1874), more analytical than Aubrey (1896). The 1910 practitioner world understood market psychology deeply; it just lacked the tools to connect that understanding to value.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Early in the textbook lineage:</strong> Greene (1902) → Mead (1910) → Lyon (1916) → Dewing (1920) → Gerstenberg (1924) → Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</li>
<li><strong>Same era as:</strong> Fisher (1907) — but with zero mutual awareness</li>
<li><strong>Contrasts with:</strong> Gerstenberg (1924) who first writes V = E/r; Dewing (1920) who recognizes earning power but still has no formula</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral insights compare with:</strong> Crump (1874), Aubrey (1896), Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</li>
<li><strong>Stream:</strong> Academic (Wharton textbook), but indistinguishable from practitioner knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Later editions:</strong> Mead (1930, 1933) — we have these too</li>
