    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Frank &amp; Goyal's 2009 <em>Financial Management</em> paper uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) model selection on Compustat data from 1950-2003 to identify which factors RELIABLY predict leverage across specifications, time periods, and firm types. Of the many variables proposed by capital structure theories, only SIX are &quot;core factors&quot; for market leverage: (1) industry median leverage (+), (2) tangibility (+), (3) market-to-book ratio (−), (4) profitability (−), (5) log of assets/firm size (+), and (6) expected inflation (+). These six account for over 27% of leverage variation; all remaining factors add only about 2%. Five of the six are consistent with the trade-off theory. The one exception — the NEGATIVE sign on profitability — contradicts the trade-off model's prediction that profitable firms should have more leverage (to exploit tax shields). This confirms the Fama &amp; French (2002) finding that the profitability-leverage puzzle is the central empirical embarrassment for trade-off theory. Notably, the profitability coefficient declined substantially over time: from −0.54 in the 1950s to −0.05 in the 2000s, suggesting the effect is weakening. For the EPS project, this paper systematically documents that profitability is one of the six most important leverage determinants, with a sign that contradicts NPV-based theories but is natural under the EPS paradigm.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Motivation and Approach (Section I, pp. 1-8)</h3>
<p>The capital structure literature has proposed dozens of factors affecting leverage, drawn from multiple theories (trade-off, pecking order, market timing, agency). The problem: many factors are statistically significant in isolation but lose significance when combined, or work in some subsamples but not others. Frank &amp; Goyal ask: which factors are RELIABLY important across all reasonable specifications?</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> BIC-based model selection. Start with a comprehensive set of factors, then eliminate those whose removal improves the BIC (i.e., whose marginal contribution doesn't justify the added complexity). This is more disciplined than simply reporting significance in one regression.</p>
<p><strong>Factors considered (11 categories, ~25 variables):</strong></p>
<p>From trade-off theory: industry leverage, tangibility, size, expected inflation, nondebt tax shields
From pecking order: profitability, cash flow volatility, uniqueness
From market timing: market-to-book ratio
From agency theory: dividends, free cash flow
Other: age, regulation, credit ratings, macroeconomic conditions</p>
<h3>Data (Section II, pp. 8-12)</h3>
<ul>
<li>All US publicly traded firms on Compustat, 1950-2003</li>
<li>Dependent variable: total debt to market value of assets (TDM) for market leverage; total debt to book assets (TDA) for book leverage</li>
<li>198,411 firm-year observations (varying by specification)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table I: Descriptive Statistics (p. 10)</h3>
<p>Mean TDM (market leverage) = 0.32; mean TDA (book leverage) = 0.28. High cross-sectional variation (standard deviations of 0.25 and 0.22 respectively).</p>
<h3>Table III: Core Factor Selection (Section III, pp. 12-18)</h3>
<p><strong>The BIC elimination process for market leverage (TDM):</strong></p>
<p>Starting with all factors, sequentially remove the factor whose elimination most improves (or least worsens) the BIC. The process converges to SIX core factors:</p>

</table>
<p><strong>The eliminated factors include:</strong> dividends, cash flow volatility, nondebt tax shields, uniqueness, age, regulation, credit ratings, and various macroeconomic variables. These are NOT necessarily unrelated to leverage — they are just NOT reliably important after controlling for the six core factors.</p>
<p><strong>R² contribution:</strong> The six core factors produce R² &gt; 0.27 for market leverage. Adding all remaining factors increases R² by only ~0.02.</p>
<h3>Table IV: Robustness Across Firm Types (pp. 18-22)</h3>
<p>The six core factors are tested separately for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividend payers vs. nonpayers</li>
<li>Large vs. small firms</li>
<li>Low-growth vs. high-growth firms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key result:</strong> All six factors maintain their sign and significance across ALL subsamples. The profitability effect (−) is robust for payers and nonpayers, large and small, growth and value. This is not driven by a specific subset of firms.</p>

<p><strong>Critical observation:</strong> The profitability effect has been DECLINING monotonically. In the 1950s, the coefficient was −0.54; by the 2000s, it was only −0.05. Meanwhile, the market-to-book effect (which captures market timing or growth options) has been relatively stable since the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>Industry median leverage</strong> has also declined in importance, from +0.68 to +0.26, though it remains the single most important factor.</p>
<h3>Table VI: Minor Factors (pp. 28-32)</h3>
<p>When minor factors are added back individually to the six-factor core model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Significant and negative (−0.05 to −0.08). Dividend payers have less leverage. But not robust enough to be &quot;core.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Cash flow volatility:</strong> Sometimes significant, but sensitive to measurement and sample.</li>
<li><strong>Nondebt tax shields (Depreciation/A):</strong> Mixed signs, not reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Credit ratings:</strong> Having a rating is associated with slightly more leverage, but effect is small.</li>
<li><strong>Financial deficit (pecking order test):</strong> Significant but explains little incremental variance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Book Leverage vs. Market Leverage (pp. 33-35)</h3>
<p>For book leverage (TDA), the picture is DIFFERENT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market-to-book LOSES reliability (inconsistent sign)</li>
<li>Firm size (ln A) becomes less reliable</li>
<li>Expected inflation loses significance</li>
<li>Only industry median, tangibility, and profitability are clearly reliable for book leverage</li>
</ul>
<p>This is important: many of the &quot;core factors&quot; are core only for market leverage. Book leverage has a sparser set of determinants.</p>
<h3>Section V: Conclusions (pp. 35-37)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We find that the most reliable factors for explaining market leverage among publicly traded American firms are: median industry leverage (+ effect on leverage), market-to-book assets ratio (− effect), tangibility (+ effect), profits (− effect), log of assets (+ effect), and expected inflation (+ effect).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Five of the six signs are consistent with the trade-off theory... The only factor that is problematic for the tradeoff theory is the profits factor.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No single theory explains all six factors. The pecking order explains the profitability sign but makes wrong predictions about several other factors. Market timing explains the market-to-book sign but is not a complete theory. The trade-off theory comes closest to a unified explanation — with profitability as its Achilles heel.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Profitability Is a Core Factor with the &quot;Wrong&quot; Sign for Trade-Off Theory</h3>
<p>The paper's most important contribution for the EPS project is the systematic confirmation that profitability is one of the six most reliably important factors — and that its negative sign is robust across every subsample, decade, and specification. This is exactly the &quot;important failure&quot; Fama &amp; French (2002) identified, now confirmed with rigorous model selection methodology. In the EPS paradigm, the sign is natural: profitable firms have low earnings yields, making equity &quot;cheap&quot; relative to debt, so they have less incentive to lever up.</p>
<h3>2. The Declining Profitability Coefficient Is Consistent with the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>The profitability coefficient declined from −0.54 (1950s) to −0.05 (2000s). In the EPS paradigm, this could reflect the declining interest rate environment: as borrowing costs fell, the gap between the earnings yield and the borrowing rate changed, altering the EPS-accretive leverage calculation. As rates fell, even firms with moderate earnings yields found debt-financed buybacks EPS-accretive, weakening the cross-sectional relationship between profitability and leverage. This connects directly to the Ben-David, Chinco, Meli (EPS and Financial Markets) paper.</p>
<h3>3. Industry Median Leverage as the Top Factor Supports Comps-Based Behavior</h3>
<p>The single most important factor is industry median leverage — firms target the leverage of their peers. This is exactly what the EPS paradigm would predict: managers use comparable firms (&quot;comps&quot;) as benchmarks for both pricing and capital structure. If peers are more levered, the firm levers up to match, because falling behind on EPS relative to peers (who are boosting EPS through leverage) creates competitive pressure.</p>
<h3>4. Market-to-Book Captures What the EPS Paradigm Calls the Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>The market-to-book ratio is the inverse of the book-to-market ratio, and is closely related to the P/E ratio (Penman &amp; Reggiani 2018 show B/P = (1/ROE) × E/P). The negative sign on market-to-book means high-valuation firms have LESS leverage — which in the EPS paradigm means low-earnings-yield firms (expensive equity in the traditional sense, but CHEAP equity in the EPS sense) don't need leverage to boost EPS.</p>
<h3>5. Tangibility and Size Are Consistent with EPS Paradigm's Debt Access Story</h3>
<p>Tangibility (+) and size (+) likely reflect access to debt markets more than trade-off considerations. In the EPS paradigm, firms that CAN borrow cheaply (tangible assets for collateral, large firms with good credit) DO borrow — because they can exploit the earnings yield vs. borrowing cost spread more efficiently. These factors determine the ABILITY to execute EPS-accretive leverage, not the DESIRE for tax shields.</p>
<h3>6. The Six-Factor Framework Maps onto EPS Determinants of Leverage</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, leverage is determined by: (i) the earnings yield (proxied by profitability and market-to-book), (ii) the borrowing cost (proxied by tangibility, size, and credit conditions), and (iii) peer behavior (proxied by industry median leverage). Frank &amp; Goyal's six core factors correspond almost exactly to these three EPS-paradigm determinants. The trade-off theory needs SIX independent rationales; the EPS paradigm generates the same predictions from one principle.</p>
<h3>7. Book Leverage Loses Several Core Factors — Consistent with EPS Focus</h3>
<p>The finding that market-to-book, size, and inflation lose reliability for book leverage is consistent with the EPS paradigm's focus on MARKET leverage (since P = EPS × P/E is a market pricing equation). The earnings yield is a market-based measure (E/P where P is market price), so the EPS paradigm's predictions map more naturally onto market leverage than book leverage.</p>
