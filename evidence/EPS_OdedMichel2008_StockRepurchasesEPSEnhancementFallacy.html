    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Oded &amp; Michel's 2008 <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em> paper argues that the commonly held belief that stock repurchases create value by increasing EPS is a &quot;fallacy.&quot; Using a numerical example and an application to ExxonMobil's 2002-2006 repurchase program, they demonstrate that while repurchases do increase EPS relative to dividends or cash accumulation, the total wealth of shareholders (share value + cash received) is IDENTICAL under all three payout policies in a perfect market. The EPS increase from repurchases is merely a risk-return trade-off: by distributing cash (a safe asset), the firm becomes riskier (higher proportion of risky assets), which increases expected earnings per share but also increases risk per share. The ExxonMobil application shows that about 16% of the company's EPS growth from 2002-2006 ($0.83 out of $5.06 total growth) was attributable to the repurchase program rather than operating performance -- specifically, actual 2006 EPS was $6.68, while EPS without repurchases would have been $5.85. They note that &quot;an underinformed or naive analyst might inappropriately attribute this increase to enhanced operating efficiency and/or effectiveness.&quot; For the EPS project, this paper is significant because it simultaneously (1) confirms that practitioners DO treat EPS enhancement as value-creating (the &quot;fallacy&quot; the paper attacks), (2) provides a clean analytical framework showing how repurchases mechanically boost EPS, and (3) inadvertently demonstrates the power of the EPS paradigm -- if EPS enhancement doesn't create value, why do firms do it? The answer is that in the EPS paradigm, managers maximize EPS as the objective function, not shareholder wealth.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Setup: Three Payout Policies (pp. 63-70)</h3>
<p><strong>The firm:</strong> All-equity firm, 1 million shares at $10/share. Balance sheet: $5M risky assets (15% return) + $5M cash (5% return). Total value: $10M. Expected total earnings: $1M ($750K from risky + $250K from cash). EPS = $1.00.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 1 -- Cash Accumulation (Table 1):</strong>
The firm retains all earnings and reinvests in safe assets. Result: firm value grows (cash accumulates), shares outstanding stay at 1M, stock price increases, EPS increases. By Year 10: firm value $22.58M, EPS $1.55, stock price $22.58. The risky/safe asset ratio DECLINES over time (to 0.28 by Year 10) -- the firm gets safer.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 2 -- Stock Repurchase (Table 2):</strong>
The firm uses all earnings to repurchase shares. Result: firm value STAYS at $10M (cash distributed = earnings, no accumulation), but shares outstanding DECLINE (to 0.909M in Year 1, 0.386M by Year 10). EPS INCREASES (to $1.10 in Year 1, $2.36 by Year 10). Stock price INCREASES ($11 in Year 1, $25.94 by Year 10). The risky/safe asset ratio stays at 1.00 -- risk doesn't change.</p>
<p><strong>KEY INSIGHT:</strong> Total value to shareholders is IDENTICAL under both policies. Under cash accumulation, value is in the firm. Under repurchase, value is split between the firm and cash in shareholders' pockets (from selling shares). Total = same.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3 -- Dividends (Table 3):</strong>
The firm pays all earnings as dividends. Result: firm value STAYS at $10M, shares outstanding stay at 1M, EPS stays at $1.00, stock price stays at $10 (ex-dividend). Again, total shareholder value is identical.</p>
<h3>The EPS Comparison (Figure 4)</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 4, Panel B:</strong> By Year 10, EPS under the three policies diverges dramatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repurchase: $2.36 (52% higher than cash accumulation)</li>
<li>Cash accumulation: $1.55</li>
<li>Dividends: $1.00 (36% lower than cash accumulation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet total shareholder wealth is IDENTICAL. The EPS differences are entirely mechanical -- they reflect different risk profiles, not different value creation.</p>
<h3>The Mechanism (pp. 65-66)</h3>
<p><strong>Why does repurchase boost EPS?</strong> Two effects:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fewer shares outstanding:</strong> The denominator shrinks, mechanically increasing EPS.</li>
<li><strong>Less safe cash in the firm:</strong> The numerator composition changes -- the firm holds a higher proportion of risky (high-return) assets, so expected earnings per dollar of assets is higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;The retirement of cash causes the relative weight of the safe asset (cash) in the firm's asset composition to decrease whereas the relative weight of the risky assets increases. No value is added, however&quot; (p. 65).</p>
<p><strong>The risk-return trade-off:</strong> &quot;Overall, expected EPS is higher in the repurchase scenario than in the cash accumulation scenario because the expected return on the firm's assets increases with share repurchase. The reason is that the retirement of cash... causes the expected return on assets to be greater in the repurchase case&quot; (p. 65).</p>
<h3>EPS-Maximizing Firms (p. 71)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For the firm that is maximizing EPS, the stock repurchase plan described here yields the largest EPS. Again, however, this effect is not associated with a change in overall shareholder wealth; the shareholder is equally well off under all policies.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the paper's direct engagement with the EPS paradigm: repurchase IS the EPS-maximizing policy, but the EPS increase &quot;is not associated with a change in overall shareholder wealth.&quot;</p>
<h3>Application: ExxonMobil 2002-2006 (Tables 4-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 4 -- Actual Data:</strong> ExxonMobil spent $29.6B on repurchases in 2006 alone (the largest in S&amp;P 500 history at the time). Shares declined from 6,809M (2002) to 5,729M (2006). EPS grew from $1.62 to $6.68.</p>

<p><strong>Table 6 -- Summary:</strong> The repurchase program added $0.83 to EPS by 2006 ($6.68 - $5.85). This represents about <strong>16.4%</strong> of total EPS growth over the period: 1 - (5.85 - 1.62) / (6.68 - 1.62) = 16.4%.</p>
<p><strong>The quote that motivated the paper (opening epigraph):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Exxon spent 60%, or $29 billion, of its cash flow on repurchases in 2006, more than any other firm in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and a tenfold increase since 2000. The firm has retired 16% of its shares in the past five years, adding an estimated 88 cents to earnings of $6.68 per share.&quot; -- <em>BusinessWeek</em>, May 28, 2007</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper argues this framing -- treating $0.88 EPS enhancement as value creation -- is misleading.</p>
<h3>Reconciling with Reality (pp. 70-71)</h3>
<p>The authors acknowledge their perfect-market result doesn't hold exactly in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information asymmetry:</strong> If managers believe shares are undervalued, repurchases at below-intrinsic-value transfer wealth from selling to remaining shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>Optimal asset mix:</strong> &quot;A firm that holds more cash than needed for its operations... is usually destroying value for its shareholders because the return on the cash that it generates is lower than its cost of capital&quot; -- so disbursing cash through repurchases CAN add value by eliminating negative-NPV cash holdings.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Corporate tax on cash earnings makes both dividends and repurchases tax-advantageous relative to cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>Signaling:</strong> Repurchase signals persistent free cash flow generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>But: &quot;To the extent that the managers are correct in either of these beliefs, the shareholders who hold their equity stake from time zero may have a greater probability of maximizing overall wealth in reality than they do in theory&quot; (p. 71).</p>
<h3>Accelerated Repurchases (p. 74)</h3>
<p>The paper also discusses accelerated share repurchases (ASRs): &quot;In an accelerated repurchase, the firm borrows a large quantity of shares from its shareholders through an investment banker and retires those shares upon receipt... Accelerated repurchases enable a firm to quickly increase EPS while repurchasing shares slowly over time.&quot;</p>
<p>This is explicitly described as a mechanism to &quot;quickly increase EPS&quot; -- confirming that EPS enhancement is the stated motivation.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Confirms the Practitioner Belief That EPS Enhancement = Value Creation</h3>
<p>The paper's very existence confirms that practitioners DO treat EPS growth from repurchases as value-creating. The BusinessWeek epigraph presents ExxonMobil's $0.88 EPS enhancement as a positive achievement. Oded &amp; Michel call this a &quot;fallacy&quot; -- but for the EPS project, the important finding is the practitioner belief, not its correctness.</p>
<h3>2. Repurchases Are the EPS-Maximizing Payout Policy</h3>
<p>The paper explicitly states: &quot;For the firm that is maximizing EPS, the stock repurchase plan described here yields the largest EPS.&quot; This confirms the EPS paradigm's prediction: repurchases dominate dividends and cash accumulation in EPS terms. The switch from dividends to repurchases as the dominant payout channel (documented by Grullon &amp; Michaely 2002) is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts.</p>
<h3>3. 16% of ExxonMobil's EPS Growth Was &quot;Artificial&quot;</h3>
<p>The finding that 16.4% of ExxonMobil's EPS growth was attributable to financial engineering (repurchases) rather than operating performance provides a concrete quantification of how much EPS growth is driven by payout policy. For the EPS paradigm, this isn't a distortion -- it's a feature. The EPS maximizer uses all available tools (operations AND financial policy) to boost EPS.</p>
<h3>4. The &quot;Fallacy&quot; Framing Reveals the Academic-Practitioner Divide</h3>
<p>The paper frames EPS enhancement as a &quot;fallacy&quot; because total shareholder wealth is unchanged in perfect markets. This is the NPV paradigm's perspective: value maximization is the correct objective, and EPS changes that don't change value are misleading. The EPS paradigm's perspective is different: managers ARE maximizing EPS, and the fact that repurchases produce the highest EPS is WHY firms repurchase. Whether this &quot;creates value&quot; in the NPV sense is beside the point -- managers are pursuing a different objective function.</p>
<h3>5. The Risk-Return Mechanism Is the EPS Paradigm's Cost of Equity</h3>
<p>The paper's explanation -- repurchases increase EPS by shifting the firm toward riskier assets (removing safe cash) -- is the EPS paradigm's capital structure logic in a different guise. The EPS paradigm says firms lever up (or distribute cash) because the earnings yield exceeds the safe rate. Oded &amp; Michel show that distributing cash (which earns the safe rate) concentrates the firm in risky assets (which earn the higher rate), mechanically boosting EPS. Same mechanism, different framing.</p>
<h3>6. The ExxonMobil Quote Shows EPS Language in the Wild</h3>
<p>The BusinessWeek quote -- &quot;adding an estimated 88 cents to earnings of $6.68 per share&quot; -- is a perfect example of how the financial press evaluates corporate actions through the EPS lens. Repurchases are reported in terms of their EPS impact, not their NPV. The press, like practitioners, uses the EPS paradigm's language naturally.</p>
<h3>7. Accelerated Repurchases Confirm EPS as the Objective</h3>
<p>The discussion of accelerated share repurchases -- where firms &quot;borrow&quot; shares to retire them immediately, boosting EPS before the actual buyback occurs -- reveals that EPS timing matters. Firms structure repurchases to maximize near-term EPS, not long-term value. This temporal dimension of EPS maximization connects to the earnings benchmark literature (Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal 2005) and the finding that 78% of managers would sacrifice long-term value for smooth earnings.</p>

<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Document the EPS accretion condition: EPS/P &gt; r_d. Oded &amp; Michel provide the analytical framework showing WHY repurchases boost EPS (retiring low-return cash concentrates the firm in high-return assets).</li>
<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> -- &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Find that firms repurchase to offset ESO dilution. Oded &amp; Michel show that this repurchase-driven EPS enhancement does not create value in perfect markets -- but firms do it anyway because EPS is the objective function.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> -- &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show that EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out investment. Oded &amp; Michel provide the motivation: repurchases are the EPS-maximizing payout, and firms choose them over investment when investment would dilute EPS.</li>
<li><strong>Brav, Graham, Harvey &amp; Michaely (2005)</strong> -- &quot;Payout Policy in the 21st Century.&quot; 76.1% say &quot;increasing EPS&quot; is important for repurchases. Oded &amp; Michel analyze exactly this motivation and call it a &quot;fallacy.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> -- &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; 67.1% say EPS is very important; 78% would sacrifice long-term value for smooth earnings. The EPS enhancement from repurchases is one mechanism through which managers achieve this.</li>
<li><strong>Grullon &amp; Michaely (2002)</strong> -- &quot;Dividends, Share Repurchases, and the Substitution Hypothesis.&quot; Document the shift from dividends to repurchases. Oded &amp; Michel explain why: repurchases produce higher EPS growth than dividends (Table 6: dividends LOWER EPS by $0.14 relative to repurchases).</li>
<li><strong>Stern (1974)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings per Share Don't Count.&quot; Like Oded &amp; Michel, Stern argues that EPS is the wrong criterion. Both papers demonstrate that EPS-based reasoning leads to suboptimal decisions -- yet both document that practitioners use EPS anyway. The persistence of EPS-based decision-making from 1974 to 2008 is itself evidence for the EPS paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> -- Oded &amp; Michel confirm that repurchases are the EPS-maximizing payout policy. The EPS paradigm predicts this: when the earnings yield exceeds the safe rate (which it almost always does), distributing cash via repurchase boosts EPS. The 16% artificial EPS growth at ExxonMobil quantifies the magnitude of the effect for a specific, large firm.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> -- Oded &amp; Michel's comparison of the three payout policies (Table 6) directly maps onto the EPS-and-dividends paper's framework: dividends reduce EPS, repurchases boost EPS, cash accumulation is intermediate. The EPS maximizer unambiguously prefers repurchases.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> -- The ExxonMobil case study ($29B repurchases in 2006 alone) is a microcosm of the aggregate pattern: as interest rates fell in the 2000s, the gap between the earnings yield and the safe rate widened, making repurchases increasingly EPS-accretive, driving the buyback boom.</li>
