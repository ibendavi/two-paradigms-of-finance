    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Graham &amp; Dodd's <em>Security Analysis</em> (2nd edition, 1940) establishes the practitioner's framework for equity valuation based on &quot;intrinsic value&quot; — a deliberately approximate concept defined as the range of value justified by facts (assets, earnings, dividends, prospects) — distinct from, and often divergent from, market price. The book documents a three-stage historical evolution of common stock valuation: (1) the prewar &quot;threefold concept&quot; (dividends, earnings, assets), (2) the 1920s &quot;new-era theory&quot; (value depends entirely on future earnings trends), and (3) Graham's own &quot;newer canons&quot; centered on margin of safety. The work bridges the practitioner and academic streams, citing Williams (1938) and Preinreich (1935) on discounting, while rejecting mathematical precision in favor of qualitative judgment. The famous dictum that the market is &quot;a voting machine&quot; rather than &quot;a weighing machine&quot; encapsulates their behavioral insight about short-run price determination.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Concept of Intrinsic Value (Ch. I, pp. 20-22)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. It needs only to establish either that the value is adequate — e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase — or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price.&quot; (p. 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Intrinsic value is NOT a precise number.</strong> This is a fundamental departure from later academic valuation models (Williams 1938, Gordon 1956) which produce point estimates. Graham views intrinsic value as a range or zone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is a great mistake to imagine that intrinsic value is as definite and as determinable as is the market price.&quot; (p. 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;that value which is justified by the facts, e.g., the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct, let us say, from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excesses.&quot; (p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Market as Voting Machine (Ch. I, p. 27)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the market is not a weighing machine, on which the value of each issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities. Rather should we say that the market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals register choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Graham's most famous metaphor. It encapsulates his view that market prices reflect psychology and sentiment in the short run but converge toward intrinsic value in the long run.</p>
<h3>Three Functions of Security Analysis (Ch. I, pp. 18-19)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Descriptive function</strong> — marshaling facts about a security in coherent form</li>
<li><strong>Selective function</strong> — expressing judgments about whether to buy, sell, or hold</li>
<li><strong>Critical function</strong> — applying standards of safety to specific securities</li>
</ol>
<h3>Investment vs. Speculation (Ch. IV, pp. 54-59)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.&quot; (p. 54)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five common but rejected distinctions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bonds vs. stocks (rejected: some bonds are speculative, some stocks are investments)</li>
<li>Outright purchase vs. margin purchase (rejected: method of purchase is separate from quality)</li>
<li>Permanent holding vs. quick resale (rejected: time horizon alone doesn't determine character)</li>
<li>Income vs. profit motive (rejected: both can be present in investment)</li>
<li>Safe vs. risky (rejected: &quot;safety is measured not by specific lien but by the power to pay&quot;)</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Three Stages of Common Stock Valuation (Ch. XXVII, pp. 351-358)</h3>
<p><strong>Stage 1: The Prewar Threefold Concept (pre-1927)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Investment in Common Stocks Based on Threefold Concept. It was the standard view that a satisfactory common stock was one which had a (1) suitable and well-established dividend record, (2) a stable earnings record, (3) a satisfactory backing of tangible assets.&quot; (p. 351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the balance-sheet-plus-earnings approach, consistent with what we see in Lyon (1917) and Gerstenberg (1924).</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2: The New-Era Theory (1927-1929)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The value of a common stock depends entirely upon what it will earn in the future.&quot; (p. 351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key tenets of the new-era theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only future earnings matter; past record is irrelevant</li>
<li>Good-will and &quot;earning power&quot; supersede asset values</li>
<li>A trend of increasing earnings justifies any price</li>
</ul>
<p>Graham's devastating critique:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the new-era theory led directly to this conclusion.&quot; (p. 354)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stage 3: Graham's Newer Canons (post-1929)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Return to quantitative standards</li>
<li>Emphasis on margin of safety</li>
<li>Invest &quot;at times when the general market is low, measured by quantitative standards of value&quot; (p. 369)</li>
<li>The goal: buy stocks at a price below intrinsic value by a sufficient margin</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Dividend Factor (Ch. XXVII-XXVIII, pp. 359-371)</h3>
<p>Graham criticizes the new-era theory's dismissal of dividends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A dollar of earnings is worth more to the stockholder if given to him in dividends than when carried to surplus.&quot; (p. 359)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnote on p. 360</strong> — Cites <strong>Preinreich (1935)</strong> and <strong>Williams (1938)</strong> on the mathematical demonstration that a stock's value equals the discounted sum of future dividends. Graham acknowledges the theoretical validity but is skeptical of practical application:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This mathematical demonstration is flawless, but its practical utility is vitiated by the extreme uncertainty of the dividend payments to be 'discounted.'&quot; (paraphrase of Graham's position, p. 360)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The P/E Ratio Framework (Ch. XXXIX, pp. 530-533)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A given common stock is generally considered to be worth a certain number of times its current earnings. This number of times, or multiplier, depends partly on the prevailing psychology and partly on the nature and record of the enterprise.&quot; (p. 530)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historical standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Prior to the 1927-1929 bull market ten times earnings was the accepted standard of measurement.&quot; (p. 530)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham's ceiling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;about 20 times average earnings is as high a price as can be paid in an investment purchase of a common stock&quot; (p. 532)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;people who habitually purchase common stocks at more than about 20 times their average earnings are likely to lose considerable money in the long run&quot; (p. 533)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the fundamental problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Exact Appraisal Impossible — Security analysis cannot presume to lay down general rules as to the 'proper value' of any given common stock. Practically speaking, there is no such thing.&quot; (p. 531)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Margin of Safety (Ch. XXVIII, pp. 368-370)</h3>
<p>The central operational principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the analyst is convinced that a stock is worth more than he pays for it, and if he is reasonably optimistic as to the company's future, he would consider the stock a suitable purchase.&quot; (p. 368)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires buying at a price substantially below estimated intrinsic value — the &quot;margin of safety&quot; that protects against error in the estimate and adverse future events.</p>
<h3>Earnings Analysis (Chs. XXXVII-XXXVIII, pp. 506-525)</h3>
<p>Graham emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AVERAGE earnings over a business cycle (typically 7-10 years), not peak or trough earnings</li>
<li>Adjust for non-recurring items, accounting changes, and inventory methods</li>
<li>Distinguish between &quot;reported earnings&quot; and &quot;true earnings&quot;</li>
<li>Be skeptical of management's presentation of results</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Practitioner's Response to Williams</h3>
<p>Where Williams (1938) formalized the DDM as a precise algebraic model, Graham explicitly rejects mathematical precision in favor of qualitative judgment. The footnote on p. 360 shows Graham was aware of the Williams/Preinreich framework but considered it impractical due to the uncertainty of future dividends. This is a deliberate philosophical choice, not ignorance.</p>
<h3>2. The Three-Stage History Documents the Field's Evolution</h3>
<p>Graham's three stages (prewar threefold -&gt; new-era -&gt; newer canons) provide a primary-source account of how practitioners thought about common stock valuation from 1900 to 1940. This narrative aligns with and enriches our synthesis.</p>
<h3>3. The Behavioral Dimension</h3>
<p>The &quot;voting machine vs. weighing machine&quot; distinction, published in 1934/1940, anticipates behavioral finance by several decades. Graham documents market irrationality not as a theoretical possibility but as an observable fact that creates investment opportunities.</p>
<h3>4. The P/E Framework as Practitioner Standard</h3>
<p>The &quot;10x earnings&quot; rule and the &quot;20x ceiling&quot; represent the dominant practitioner valuation heuristic of the era — earnings capitalization without explicit present-value reasoning. This is the practitioner counterpart to V=E/r as seen in Gerstenberg (1924).</p>
<h3>5. The Intrinsic Value Tradition Continued</h3>
<p>Graham's &quot;intrinsic value&quot; concept connects directly back to Hutcheson (1720)'s &quot;intrinsick value&quot; and Fairman (1795)'s &quot;real value.&quot; The idea that securities have a fundamental value distinct from market price is now over two centuries old — Graham formalized and operationalized it for the modern era.</p>
