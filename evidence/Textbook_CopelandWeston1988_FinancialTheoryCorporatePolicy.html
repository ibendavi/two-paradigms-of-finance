    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Copeland &amp; Weston's textbook represents the fully mature post-MM academic paradigm, and it explicitly and repeatedly attacks EPS maximization as a naive error in at least four separate contexts: (1) the firm's objective function, (2) inventory accounting (LIFO vs. FIFO), (3) merger evaluation, and (4) capital structure (the &quot;Betamax&quot; example). The book treats the case against EPS maximization as settled and obvious, yet in doing so it inadvertently documents how widespread the practice remains among managers -- precisely the gap the Ben-David &amp; Chinco research program seeks to explain.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>1. The Firm's Objective Function</h3>
<p>The book establishes its paradigm early and unambiguously. Chapter 2 (&quot;Investment Decisions: The Certainty Case&quot;) states on p. 18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The most important theme of this chapter is that the objective of the firm is to maximize the wealth of its shareholders. This will be seen to be the same as maximizing the present value of shareholders' lifetime consumption and no different than maximizing the price per share of stock.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shareholder wealth is then formally defined as the discounted value of after-tax cash flows (Eq. 2.1):</p>
<pre><code>S_o = Sum[Div_t / (1 + k_s)^t]
</code></pre>
<p>where k_s is &quot;the market-determined rate of return on equity capital (common stock).&quot; This is pure DCF valuation from the start. The cost of equity is a &quot;market-determined opportunity cost of capital for equivalent income streams&quot; -- not an earnings yield or observable market price.</p>
<p>The Fisher Separation Theorem provides the theoretical foundation: because capital markets are perfect, all shareholders unanimously agree that managers should maximize market value by investing until the marginal return equals the market rate (the &quot;unanimity principle,&quot; p. 19). This makes wealth maximization preference-free and utility-independent.</p>
<h3>2. EPS Maximization Explicitly Rejected (pp. 24-25)</h3>
<p>This is the most direct attack. Under the heading &quot;The Economic Definition of Profit&quot; (pp. 22-25), Copeland &amp; Weston draw a sharp distinction between accounting profit and economic profit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Financial managers are frequently misled when they focus on the accounting definition of profit, or earnings per share. The objective of the firm is <em>not</em> to maximize earnings per share. The correct objective is to maximize shareholders' wealth, which in turn is equivalent to the discounted cash flows of the firm.&quot; (p. 24, emphasis in original)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They provide two concrete examples of how EPS maximization leads managers astray:</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: LIFO vs. FIFO (Table 2.1, p. 24).</strong> During inflation, FIFO produces higher EPS ($0.45) than LIFO ($0.06), but LIFO produces higher cash flow per share ($0.96 vs. $0.70) because it saves taxes. &quot;Since shareholders care only about discounted cash flow, they will assign a higher value to the shares of the company using LIFO accounting.&quot; A manager maximizing EPS would choose FIFO -- the wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2: Goodwill in mergers (pp. 25).</strong> Under purchase accounting, goodwill amortization reduces reported EPS but has no effect on cash flows (it is a non-cash charge with no tax effect). Copeland &amp; Weston cite Gagnon [1971] as evidence that &quot;managers choose to use pooling rather than purchase if the write-off of goodwill is substantial,&quot; indicating that managers behave &quot;as if they were trying to maximize earnings per share.&quot; They call this &quot;unfortunate&quot; because &quot;some mergers that are advantageous to the shareholders of acquiring firms may be rejected by management if substantial goodwill write-offs are required.&quot;</p>
<p>They then address the counterargument directly (p. 25):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is often argued that maximization of earnings per share is appropriate if investors use earnings per share to value the stock. There is good empirical evidence to indicate that this is not the case. Shareholders do in fact value securities according to the present value of discounted cash flows.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. EPS Growth Maximization as &quot;Inappropriate Goal&quot; (pp. 550-551)</h3>
<p>In the dividend policy theory chapter (Chapter 15), Section B.2 is titled &quot;Why Earnings per Share Growth Maximization Is an Inappropriate Goal.&quot; Using the valuation equation (Eq. 15.16):</p>
<pre><code>V_0 = NOI_1/p + Sum[I_t(r_t - p) / p(1+p)^t]
    = Value of assets in place + Value of future growth
</code></pre>
<p>Copeland &amp; Weston construct Table 15.2 showing three firms with different investment amounts ($10,000, $30,000, $100,000), rates of return (20%, 10%, 5%), and resulting &quot;growth&quot; in earnings ($2,000, $3,000, $5,000). Firm 3 has the greatest growth in earnings but <em>destroys</em> value (delta-V = -$45,454) because its return (5%) is below the required rate (10%). The conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Therefore the objective of a firm should <em>never</em> be to simply maximize growth in earnings or cash flows. The objective should be to maximize the market value of the firm, which is equivalent to maximizing wealth.&quot; (p. 550)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is followed by the observation that value depends on the <em>spread</em> between r and p, not on the level of earnings growth. The footnote on the same page acknowledges the practical importance of this type of growth-value decomposition, noting it &quot;is the basis for most commonly used valuation models, e.g., ALCAR.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. The &quot;Betamax&quot; Example: EPS-Maximizing Capital Structure (pp. 523-526)</h3>
<p>This is perhaps the most telling passage for the Ben-David &amp; Chinco research program. In Chapter 14 (&quot;Capital Structure: Empirical Evidence and Applications&quot;), Section D begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Companies with high price/earnings ratios can increase their accounting earnings per share by issuing new equity and using the funds to buy back debt. Carried to the extreme, this process results in an optimal capital structure that contains zero debt. Much of the theory in Chapter 13 and the empirical evidence earlier in this chapter suggest that this idea is wrong.&quot; (p. 523)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example (Table 14.10, p. 524): &quot;Betamax&quot; has a P/E of 50, EPS of $1.00, and 10 shares at $50 each. After issuing 10 new shares and retiring $500 of 8% debt:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPS rises from $1.00 to $1.50 (a 50% increase)</li>
<li>Price per share rises from $50 to $75 (if the P/E holds at 50)</li>
<li>But <strong>firm value falls</strong> from $1,500 to $1,250 because the tax shield is lost</li>
</ul>
<p>The passage then delivers the key lesson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The above example shows that if a firm with a high price/earnings ratio seeks to maximize earnings per share, it will carry little or no debt. The problem of course is that shareholders care about net cash flows (and the gain from leverage), not earnings per share. In the above example, the change in operating cash flows is zero.&quot; (p. 524)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copeland &amp; Weston then compute the equilibrium share price after the transaction and show it falls from $50 to $25 per share -- the P/E ratio does not hold constant as the naive EPS analysis assumes.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the passage at the bottom of p. 605 reinforces this in the Bethlehem Steel valuation example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If new investment does not meet this criterion [r &gt; WACC], it cannot possibly increase value (although, as was shown in Chapter 15, if 0 &lt; r &lt; WACC it might cause growth in earnings per share).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This parenthetical concedes the central insight of the EPS paradigm: investment that destroys value can still grow EPS, and managers who maximize EPS will pursue such investments.</p>
<h3>5. Mergers: The EPS Criterion Is &quot;In Error&quot; (pp. 764-765)</h3>
<p>Chapter 20 constructs a detailed merger analysis comparing the &quot;EPS criterion&quot; with the &quot;valuation framework.&quot; Table 20.9 (&quot;EPS Analysis of Merger,&quot; p. 765) shows that Allison Corporation's EPS would decline 47% if it acquires Connors and 39% if it acquires Dorden. An EPS-maximizing manager would reject both.</p>
<p>But the valuation analysis (pp. 766-768, Table 20.10) shows that Allison/Connors creates $4 million of value while Allison/Dorden destroys $24 million. The verdict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We believe this widely used criterion is in error. It is the effect on market value that is relevant, not the effect on earnings per share.&quot; (p. 765)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;widely used criterion&quot; is significant -- it concedes that the EPS criterion is in fact how practitioners evaluate mergers, even as the textbook insists they should not.</p>
<h3>6. The Exchange Ratio Model (pp. 757-763)</h3>
<p>The merger terms model (Larson-Gonedes) is itself built on the P/E framework. The exchange ratio is determined by solving for the postmerger P/E:</p>
<pre><code>P12 = (PE_12)(EPS_12)
</code></pre>
<p>where EPS_12 = (E_1 + E_2) / (S_1 + S_2 * ER_1). The entire apparatus of merger analysis -- the four-quadrant diagram (Figure 20.1), the buyer/seller wealth constraints, the premium/discount calculations (Table 20.4) -- uses P/E ratios as the central tool. This implicitly concedes that practitioners think in P/E terms, even though the &quot;correct&quot; analysis uses DCF.</p>
<h3>7. Cost of Capital: CAPM, Not Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>The cost of equity is derived exclusively from the CAPM (Eq. 14.6, p. 530):</p>
<pre><code>k_s = R_f + [E(R_m) - R_f] * beta_s
</code></pre>
<p>For Bethlehem Steel, this gives 13.52%. At no point is the earnings yield (E/P) mentioned as an estimate of the cost of equity. The entire cost of capital apparatus -- the WACC formula, the market value weights, the target capital structure -- follows from M-M theory. The earnings yield appears only implicitly through the P/E ratio, and only as a descriptive market statistic, never as a pricing input.</p>
<h3>8. The M-M Foundation</h3>
<p>The entire capital structure analysis is built on Modigliani-Miller. The chapter opens with the M-M epigraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The average cost of capital to any firm is completely independent of its capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity stream of its class.&quot; -- F. Modigliani and M. H. Miller, &quot;The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment,&quot; <em>American Economic Review</em>, June 1958, 268.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proposition I: V^L = V^U + T_c * B (Eq. 13.5). The value of the levered firm equals the unlevered firm plus the tax shield. Capital structure irrelevance (without taxes) and the tax-shield theory (with taxes) are presented as the foundational results. The cost of equity rises linearly with leverage (Eq. 13.18): k_s = p + (1 - T_c)(p - k_b)(B/S).</p>
<h3>9. Valuation: DCF Throughout, Never Capitalization</h3>
<p>All valuation in the book uses discounted cash flow. The fundamental valuation equation for a firm with finite supernormal growth (Eq. 15.25 / 16.18):</p>
<pre><code>V^L = E(NOI_1)(1 - T_c)/p + T_c * B + K[E(NOI_1)(1 - T_c)] * T * [(r - WACC) / (WACC(1 + WACC))]
</code></pre>
<p>This decomposes value into: (i) assets in place capitalized at p, (ii) tax shield, (iii) present value of growth from supernormal investment. The Bethlehem Steel application (pp. 602-607) estimates the six parameters and arrives at $2.224 billion vs. an actual market value of $2.590 billion.</p>
<p>At no point is the simpler P = EPS x P/E framework used as a valuation tool. The P/E ratio appears only descriptively or in the merger exchange-ratio analysis (where it is used as a practitioner's shortcut, not as theoretically grounded valuation).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>Copeland &amp; Weston (1988) is the most important document of the <strong>fully crystallized post-MM academic consensus</strong>. It is significant for the EPS research program in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>It explicitly names EPS maximization as the enemy.</strong> Unlike many textbooks that simply ignore EPS, Copeland &amp; Weston devote multiple sections to explaining why it is wrong -- in inventory choice, merger evaluation, capital structure, and growth. This intensity of opposition reveals that EPS maximization was still perceived as a live threat to the academic paradigm as late as 1988, thirty years after M-M.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It inadvertently documents the persistence of EPS thinking.</strong> Every time the book attacks EPS maximization, it concedes that managers <em>do</em> maximize EPS. The FIFO passage says managers &quot;seem to behave as if they were trying to maximize earnings per share.&quot; The merger passage calls the EPS criterion &quot;widely used.&quot; The Betamax passage acknowledges that firms with high P/E ratios <em>do</em> retire debt to boost EPS. These concessions are evidence for the Ben-David &amp; Chinco thesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Betamax example is a mirror image of the Ben-David &amp; Chinco model.</strong> Copeland &amp; Weston show that an EPS-maximizing firm with a high P/E will carry zero debt. The Ben-David &amp; Chinco model predicts exactly this: firms with earnings yields below borrowing costs (i.e., high P/E) should have zero leverage under EPS maximization. The textbook presents this as a reductio ad absurdum; the research program presents it as a testable prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The cost of equity is exclusively CAPM-derived.</strong> There is no mention of the earnings yield as the cost of equity capital. This completes the paradigm shift documented by Solomon (1963): by 1988, the earnings yield has been fully replaced by the CAPM beta in the academic curriculum. The practitioner tradition of using E/P as the cost of equity (as in Dewing 1920, Gerstenberg 1924, Badger 1925, and Dean 1951) has been entirely erased from the graduate textbook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The p. 605 parenthetical is a quiet bombshell.</strong> The aside that unprofitable investment &quot;might cause growth in earnings per share&quot; concedes the existence of a wedge between EPS maximization and value maximization on the investment side. This is exactly the capital budgeting distortion analyzed in Ben-David &amp; Chinco's &quot;Capital Budgeting for EPS Maximizers.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Valuation is purely DCF.</strong> The six-parameter model (NOI, T_c, p, K, r, T) is entirely forward-looking and cash-flow-based. The P/E ratio is never used as a valuation input. This stands in stark contrast to the practitioner tradition where P = EPS x (comparable P/E) is the standard tool.</p>
</li>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon (1963):</strong> Solomon documented the paradigm shift from earnings capitalization to NPV in the making. Copeland &amp; Weston (1988), twenty-five years later, represents the paradigm fully entrenched. The transition is complete: earnings yield as cost of equity is gone, EPS as objective function is explicitly rejected, DCF is the universal tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weston (1962):</strong> J. Fred Weston's own earlier textbook (<em>Managerial Finance</em>, 1962) was written during the transition period. Comparing Weston 1962 with Copeland &amp; Weston 1988 would show how Weston himself moved from the traditional to the M-M paradigm over his career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brealey &amp; Myers (1981, 1984, 1988):</strong> The other major advanced corporate finance textbook of the period. Likely contains similar anti-EPS arguments but may differ in emphasis and examples. Direct comparison would be illuminating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dean (1951):</strong> Dean used the earnings yield (E/P ~ 10%) as the cost of equity while simultaneously introducing capital budgeting. By 1988, only the capital budgeting survives; the earnings yield as cost of equity has been replaced by CAPM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940):</strong> The pre-MM standard corporate finance textbook that treated earnings capitalization as the natural framework. Copeland &amp; Weston is its post-MM replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, &quot;Modeling Managers as EPS Maximizers&quot;:</strong> The Betamax example (p. 523-526) is the textbook's version of what happens when managers maximize EPS -- but presented as error rather than as a description of actual behavior. The Ben-David &amp; Chinco model formalizes this &quot;error&quot; as the actual objective function and derives its capital structure implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, &quot;Capital Budgeting for EPS Maximizers&quot;:</strong> The p. 605 parenthetical and the Table 15.2 growth example directly foreshadow the investment distortion analyzed in that paper. Firms that maximize EPS will accept negative-NPV projects that grow earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, &quot;Expected EPS times Trailing P/E&quot;:</strong> The merger analysis (Chapter 20) uses P = EPS x P/E as the practitioner's pricing tool, even as the textbook insists on DCF. This is exactly the investor-side pricing model of the EPS x P/E paper.</p>
