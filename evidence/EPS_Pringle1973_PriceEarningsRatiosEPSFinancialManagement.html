    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Pringle's 1973 <em>Financial Management</em> article is an early post-MM academic critique of using the P/E ratio and EPS as decision criteria for corporate financial management. Writing just 15 years after Modigliani-Miller (1958), Pringle argues that the &quot;P/E-EPS view&quot; — where firms with high P/E ratios prefer equity financing (because fewer shares need be issued per dollar raised) and use EPS accretion as a criterion for M&amp;A — &quot;focuses on the wrong criterion&quot; and &quot;can lead to confusion of the effects of investment decisions with those of financing decisions, and often will lead to incorrect policy decisions.&quot; He identifies two specific shortcomings: (1) EPS ignores the time value of money (which EPS to maximize — this year's? next year's? long-run?), and (2) EPS does not account for risk (a risky project with higher expected EPS is preferred over a safe one). The correct criterion, Pringle argues, is maximizing market value. The paper then demonstrates specific policy errors that result from the P/E-EPS view: low-P/E firms use TOO MUCH debt (the airlines, especially Pan American, as example), high-P/E firms use TOO LITTLE debt (Polaroid as example), and M&amp;A decisions based on EPS accretion lead firms to overpay for acquisitions that are EPS-accretive but value-destroying. The paper's central claim: &quot;the choice of debt vs. equity does not depend in any way on the firm's current price/earnings ratio.&quot; For the EPS project, this paper is significant as one of the earliest explicit statements of the academic case AGAINST the EPS paradigm — and, ironically, as one of the most complete descriptions of how the EPS paradigm actually works in practice.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The P/E-EPS View as Practitioner Doctrine (p. 34)</h3>
<p>Pringle opens by describing a well-established practitioner doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The price/earnings ratio is cited often in the financial press and elsewhere as an important consideration in several areas within financial decision-making, but especially where common stock is concerned. Where the decision is a choice between security types, the higher the P/E ratio, so the argument goes, the more attractive is equity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logic: higher P/E means fewer shares must be issued for a given amount of capital, causing less EPS dilution. &quot;When the P/E ratio is high, equity is more attractive as a means of raising funds, and investments financed by equity are more attractive than otherwise might be the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Pringle immediately rejects this: &quot;This focuses on the wrong criterion.&quot;</p>
<h3>EPS vs. Market Value (pp. 34-35)</h3>
<p><strong>Two shortcomings of EPS maximization:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Time value of money:</strong> &quot;Which EPS is to be maximized — this year's EPS? Next year's? Long-run EPS? Because most financing and capital investment decisions are multi-period in character, maximizing EPS is ambiguous because of inter-period trade-offs.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;The EPS criterion does not take account of the quality of earnings, i.e., their degree of uncertainty. If Project A has higher expected earnings than Project B, it would be preferable always to A under the EPS criterion, even though it might be far more risky.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The market-value alternative:</strong> &quot;A criterion that solves conceptually both of the above problems is that of maximizing the market value of the firm's equity. Market value includes the discounted value of all future earnings and thus takes account of effects over all relevant future periods. Trade-offs between periods are handled via discounting. Market value also deals with the problem of risk because, since investors are risk-averse, value is a function of return and risk.&quot;</p>
<h3>Distant Benefits — IBM Example (p. 35)</h3>
<p>Pringle acknowledges the tension: the market-value criterion &quot;can lead to acceptance of capital investment projects whose benefits are far in the future, with little, or even adverse, effects on near-term EPS.&quot; If the market uses near-term EPS to price stocks, applying the market-value criterion could cause a stock price DECLINE.</p>
<p><strong>IBM as counterexample:</strong> &quot;IBM is a prime example of a company with the kind of long-range outlook implied by the market-value criterion (witness its historical preference for leasing of its products over outright sale), and IBM shareholders have received consistently superior returns.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Key concession:</strong> &quot;However, the market-value criterion, consistently applied in the long term, will provide a higher total dollar return to shareholders than any other criterion.&quot; This is the academic article of faith — it may hurt near-term price, but long-run value wins.</p>
<h3>Is the Stock Correctly Priced? (pp. 35-36)</h3>
<p>Pringle engages seriously with the efficient market hypothesis as the foundation for market-value maximization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A critical assumption underlying the market-value rule — and much of the analysis of this paper — is that stock prices are determined in a competitive securities market at equilibrium based on information correctly evaluated.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He acknowledges the practitioner-academic divide: &quot;At the heart of the matter, and at the heart of much disagreement between academicians and practitioners, is an assumption with respect to the efficiency of stock market processes.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Keynes and beauty contests:</strong> Pringle quotes practitioners who view the market as &quot;essentially psychological&quot; — &quot;a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs&quot; (citing Keynes, General Theory, pp. 155-156). His response: &quot;One can reconcile the economic and psychological views by arguing that over the long run economic variables prevail.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The practical compromise:</strong> &quot;Even in a situation involving no historical precedents on which the market might base judgments, there is no case for returning to current EPS as a criterion for decisions. The shortcomings of EPS for such purposes still remain.&quot;</p>
<h3>Leverage and Value (p. 36)</h3>
<p>Pringle presents the standard post-MM trade-off theory: leverage adds value through the tax shield (interest deductibility at 48% corporate tax rate), but the risk of bankruptcy eventually offsets the tax benefit. The optimal debt/equity ratio depends on this trade-off.</p>
<p><strong>The key claim:</strong> &quot;Thus, the choice of debt vs. equity in any particular financing decision depends on the relation between the firm's existing debt/equity ratio and its target (optimal) ratio. If the existing ratio is below target, debt should be issued; otherwise, equity should be issued, or a combination of the two should be issued. <strong>In no event does the choice depend in any way on the firm's current P/E ratio.</strong>&quot;</p>
<h3>Policy Errors — Too Much Debt (p. 38)</h3>
<p><strong>The mechanism:</strong> &quot;The P/E-EPS view may lead a low P/E firm to use too much debt. When the after-tax cost of borrowing is less than the E/P ratio, an increase in leverage raises EPS. Equity appears to be 'expensive' and debt relatively more attractive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Self-reinforcing spiral:</strong> &quot;If a firm is misled to the point of pushing debt beyond the optimum, stock price may be depressed as investors take account of bankruptcy risks and costs. The P/E ratio falls, E/P rises, and the bias increases toward the use of still more debt.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The airlines example:</strong> &quot;Perhaps the best recent examples of firms that may have fallen into this trap are the airlines. Given their high operating leverage, one would expect their optimal debt/equity ratios to be below the average of all firms, yet airlines typically have been among the heavier users of debt. Pan American, of the U.S. airlines the one that has experienced perhaps the greatest financial difficulties over the past several years, recently marketed still another issue of debt (Wall Street Journal, Jan. 18, 1973). Pan American's $75 million debenture issue is particularly interesting because of its 'delayed conversion' feature, designed (according to the WSJ account) to 'avoid an immediate dilution of its stock' and the necessity of 'selling equity below book value.'&quot;</p>
<p>This is a real-time example of the EPS paradigm in action: Pan Am chose debt specifically to avoid EPS dilution, even when the firm was already overleveraged.</p>
<h3>Policy Errors — Too Little Debt (p. 38)</h3>
<p><strong>The mirror error:</strong> &quot;Potential for error in setting capital structure policy also exists in the case of firms with high P/E ratios. Unswerving application of the P/E-EPS view by such firms could lead to the use of too little debt.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The earnings yield as cost of equity:</strong> &quot;The P/E-EPS view implies the use of the E/P ratio as a measure of the 'cost of equity capital.' It is now widely recognized that the E/P ratio seriously underestimates the rate of return required by equity holders in all but a few special cases. When the after-tax cost of debt exceeds the E/P ratio, substitution of debt for equity will lower EPS.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Polaroid example:</strong> &quot;One thus may question whether the no-debt or low-debt policies of some high-growth, high P/E firms — Polaroid is a good example — really are in the best interests of shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The perverse prediction:</strong> Under the EPS view, high-P/E firms should issue equity to retire debt (since equity appears &quot;cheap&quot; relative to the earnings yield). This leads to too LITTLE leverage, foregoing the tax benefits of debt.</p>
<h3>Mergers and Acquisitions (pp. 38-39)</h3>
<p><strong>The EPS accretion trap:</strong> &quot;The argument is often made that a major reason for attaining a high P/E ratio is to 'improve the terms on which earning power can be acquired.' One way of 'acquiring earning power' is via acquisition, and the higher the P/E, the lower the number of shares that must be traded to acquire a given amount of earnings.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pringle's objection:</strong> &quot;Such a view fails to consider the expected cash flows from the acquisition over time and fails to measure the present value of those flows against the required outlay. There is an implicit assumption that the former P/E of the acquirer will be applied to the earnings of the acquiree.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The conglomerate connection:</strong> &quot;The cumulated effect of applying the P/E-EPS approach over a number of acquisitions could be disastrous for the price of the acquirer's stock. It would be interesting to examine the conglomerate movement of the 1960's in this light.&quot;</p>
<h3>Forsaking Attractive Investments (p. 39)</h3>
<p><strong>The investment distortion:</strong> &quot;A low P/E firm using the P/E-EPS criterion might tend to pass up investment projects or acquisitions that actually are in the interests of its shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the capital budgeting distortion that Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting) analyze: firms reject positive-NPV projects because they would dilute near-term EPS.</p>
<h3>Conclusions (p. 39)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The choice of debt vs. equity depends on where the firm presently is operating relative to its target (optimal) debt/equity ratio, which in turn depends primarily on a tradeoff between tax effects and expected bankruptcy costs. Investment decisions, including acquisitions, should be judged on the basis of the net present value criterion. In the case of neither financing decisions nor investment decisions is the firm's current P/E ratio a relevant consideration.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is not to say that a high P/E ratio is not desirable. When only investment decisions are involved, actions that raise market value will normally increase the P/E ratio, and the P/E ratio is often a good indicator of the rate of growth in earnings expected by the market.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Most Complete Early Academic Description of the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Ironically, while arguing AGAINST the P/E-EPS view, Pringle provides one of the clearest early descriptions of how it actually operates: (a) high P/E makes equity appear cheap for raising capital, (b) low P/E makes debt appear cheap, (c) EPS accretion drives M&amp;A decisions, (d) firms choose payment method to minimize EPS dilution. This is essentially the EPS paradigm as described in Ben-David &amp; Chinco, written 50 years earlier by a critic.</p>
<h3>2. The Airlines and Polaroid — Real-Time EPS Paradigm Predictions</h3>
<p>The Pan American example (low P/E, overleveraged, chose debt to avoid EPS dilution even while financially distressed) and Polaroid (high P/E, underleveraged because equity appeared &quot;cheap&quot;) are EXACTLY the predictions of the EPS paradigm's capital structure model. Pringle presents them as &quot;errors&quot; — but they are precisely what the EPS model predicts: low-earnings-yield firms lever up, high-earnings-yield firms don't.</p>
<h3>3. The Self-Reinforcing Debt Spiral</h3>
<p>Pringle's observation that debt-induced price decline lowers P/E, raises E/P, making debt appear even more attractive, describes a positive feedback loop. This is a dynamic implication of the EPS paradigm that Ben-David &amp; Chinco might explore: the EPS capital structure model can generate unstable dynamics for low-P/E firms.</p>
<h3>4. The Conglomerate Movement as EPS-Driven M&amp;A</h3>
<p>Pringle explicitly connects EPS accretion to the 1960s conglomerate wave — suggesting it &quot;would be interesting to examine the conglomerate movement of the 1960's in this light.&quot; This anticipates Andrade (1997) and Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024) by decades.</p>
<h3>5. The Academic Faith in Market Efficiency as Foundation</h3>
<p>Pringle's entire argument for market-value maximization rests on the efficient market hypothesis. He acknowledges this explicitly: if the market is NOT efficient (as practitioners believe), then the market-value criterion loses its foundation. The EPS paradigm does not require market efficiency — it works regardless of whether prices are &quot;correct.&quot;</p>
<h3>6. The Two Shortcomings That Aren't</h3>
<p>Pringle's two criticisms of EPS — ambiguity (which EPS?) and ignoring risk — are valid from the NPV perspective but miss how the EPS paradigm actually operates. Practitioners resolve the &quot;which EPS&quot; ambiguity by focusing on next-twelve-month EPS (as documented by I/B/E/S data). They handle risk through the P/E multiple (risky firms get lower P/E, so the same EPS translates to lower price). The EPS paradigm has its own internal solutions to these problems.</p>
<h3>7. 1973 Publication Date Places This in the Critical Transition Period</h3>
<p>Published just 15 years after MM (1958) and the same year as Black-Scholes (1973), this paper captures the moment when academia was consolidating its rejection of EPS in favor of market value. The practitioner world, as Pringle documents, had not followed.</p>

<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — &quot;The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment.&quot; The paper that Pringle builds on: leverage irrelevance without frictions, value maximization as the correct criterion. Pringle applies MM's logic to critique the P/E-EPS view.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — <em>The Theory of Financial Management.</em> Cited by Pringle as reference [12]. Solomon was one of the architects of the shift from EPS to market value maximization. The maxEPS paradigm paper documents this transition.</li>
<li><strong>Stern (1974)</strong> — &quot;Earnings per Share Don't Count.&quot; Published one year later in FAJ, making many of the same arguments: EPS confuses investment with financing, the AB-BA Fallacy in M&amp;A. Stern and Pringle represent the same intellectual movement.</li>
<li><strong>Andrade (1997)</strong> — &quot;Do Appearances Matter?&quot; Pringle's speculation about the conglomerate movement being driven by EPS accretion is tested empirically by Andrade, who finds exactly this pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024)</strong> — &quot;EPS Sensitivity and Merger Deals.&quot; Provide the RDD evidence that M&amp;A structure is driven by EPS accretion concerns — confirming what Pringle described as the practitioner view in 1973.</li>
<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; Show empirically that the debt-equity choice depends on EPS dilution — exactly the P/E-EPS view Pringle describes and criticizes. The E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) condition is the formalization of what Pringle calls the P/E-EPS approach to leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> — &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; Survey evidence confirming that managers still use EPS as a decision criterion 32 years after Pringle argued against it.</li>
<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> — &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Their finding that high-P/E firms repurchase to offset ESO dilution despite EPS cost is a version of the high-P/E policy error Pringle describes.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Pringle's paper is the earliest systematic academic critique of the paradigm that Ben-David &amp; Chinco propose as the actual operating model. Every &quot;policy error&quot; Pringle identifies is a PREDICTION of the EPS model: low-P/E firms lever up (too much debt per Pringle), high-P/E firms don't lever up (too little debt per Pringle), and firms use EPS accretion in M&amp;A (wrong criterion per Pringle). What Pringle calls errors, the EPS paradigm calls predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Pringle (1973) is a key document in the intellectual history: it shows that immediately after MM, academics were already fighting the practitioner P/E-EPS view. The fact that this fight continues 50 years later (Almeida 2019) suggests the academic critique has not changed practice.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — Pringle's &quot;forsaking attractive investments&quot; section describes exactly the capital budgeting distortion the EPS-and-capital-budgeting paper analyzes: low-P/E firms reject positive-NPV projects that would dilute EPS.</li>
