    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Gerstenberg presents an explicit earnings capitalization formula (V = E/r, stated as &quot;multiplier = 100/rate of return&quot;) for business valuation, a clear pre-M&amp;M treatment of leverage (&quot;trading on the equity&quot;) with numerical examples, and recognition of the tax advantage of debt — all within the descriptive-institutional framework that dominated corporate finance teaching from the 1920s-1950s. No present-value discounting, no DCF, no risk-return theory.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Earnings Capitalization Formula (Ch. 9, p. 167)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A business is worth what it will earn... its annual net earnings times an appropriate multiplier. The multiplier is 100% divided by the appropriate rate of return.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Business earning $50,000/year, fair rate 8% → value = $625,000 ($50,000 / 0.08 = $50,000 × 12.5)</p>
<p><strong>Practical case:</strong> Laundry earning $5,000/year. Seller wants $50,000 (10% return). Buyer thinks 10% too low given risk. Settle at $30,000 (16.7% return, ~6x earnings).</p>
<h3>Two Theories of Capitalization</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Earnings theory</strong> (preferred): Value based on earning power. Multiplier reflects risk.</li>
<li><strong>Cost theory</strong> (rejected): Value based on cost of assets. Unsatisfactory because idle assets don't earn returns.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Trading on the Equity (pp. 173-174)</h3>
<p>Clear numerical illustration of leverage effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100K equity earning 10%, 15%, 3% in three years</li>
<li>Add $100K debt at 5%: returns become 15%, 25%, 1%</li>
<li>&quot;In trading on the equity, gains are magnified; but so are losses&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tax Advantage of Debt (p. 172-173)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bonds are always a lower-cost security to a corporation than stocks because... the corporation can deduct the interest paid on bonds as a business expense in arriving at its income tax, thus further reducing the cost of the capital.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pre-M&amp;M tax shield recognition, though treated as practical rather than theoretical.</p>
<h3>Scientific Method for M&amp;A Valuation (p. 467-468)</h3>
<p>Two-component approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tangible assets at appraised value → assigned to preferred stock</li>
<li>Excess earning power (capitalized earnings minus tangible assets) → assigned to common stock</li>
<li>Example: Tangible $100K, earnings $25K/yr at 10% = $250K capitalized, excess = $150K goodwill</li>
</ul>
<h3>Factor of Safety / Coverage Analysis (pp. 175-176)</h3>
<p>Algebraic derivation: financial risk = (a - b) / a where a = normal revenue, b = worst-year decline. Interest coverage ratio as the key debt capacity metric.</p>
<h3>What's NOT in the Book</h3>
<ul>
<li>No present-value or DCF analysis</li>
<li>No time value of money applied to equity</li>
<li>No systematic risk-return theory</li>
<li>No portfolio theory or market equilibrium</li>
<li>No Fisher influence visible despite Fisher (1907) predating first edition by 17 years</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <ol>
<li><strong>The earnings multiplier was standard by the 1920s</strong>: V = E/r was well-established in corporate finance teaching, not new with Graham &amp; Dodd</li>
<li><strong>Pre-M&amp;M leverage analysis was clear and correct</strong>: The mechanics of leverage, including the tax advantage, were understood — what was missing was the theoretical framework showing when/whether leverage matters for total firm value</li>
<li><strong>Paradigmatic descriptive-institutional textbook</strong>: Shows what corporate finance looked like before the theoretical revolution</li>
<li><strong>Used for 35+ years</strong>: 4 editions (1924-1959) spanning the entire pre-modern era, making it one of the most influential corporate finance textbooks ever</li>
<li><strong>The V=E/r formula bridges practitioner and academic</strong>: Used in both M&amp;A practice and academic teaching</li>
</ol>

        <h4>Era</h4>
        <p><strong>The Consensus Era</strong> (1720–1957)</p>
        <p>For over 200 years, practitioners and scholars alike valued assets by capitalizing earnings at market-observed yields.</p>

      <!-- Connections -->
      
      <div class="sidebar-section">
        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Same framework as:</strong> Lyon (1917), Mead (1910), Dewing (1920) — the first generation of corp fin textbooks</li>
<li><strong>Explicitly uses the formula that:</strong> Bonbright (1937) would analyze in depth</li>
<li><strong>Would be superseded by:</strong> Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958), who showed that in perfect markets capital structure doesn't affect firm value</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;scientific method&quot; for M&amp;A</strong> foreshadows goodwill accounting and purchase price allocation in modern M&amp;A</li>
<li><strong>Compare with:</strong> Hutcheson (1720) used NAV/balance sheet; Gerstenberg uses earnings capitalization — documents the shift over 200 years</li>
