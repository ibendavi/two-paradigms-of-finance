    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Basu's 1977 <em>Journal of Finance</em> paper provides the seminal empirical evidence of the &quot;P/E effect&quot;: low P/E stocks systematically outperform high P/E stocks on a risk-adjusted basis. Using 753 NYSE industrial firms over April 1957-March 1971, Basu forms five portfolios annually ranked by P/E ratio and finds that the lowest P/E quintile (E) earned 13.55% annually vs. 9.34% for the highest P/E quintile (A), with Jensen's alpha of +4.7% (t=3.98) for low P/E and -3.3% (t=-2.62) for high P/E — despite nearly identical systematic risk (betas of 0.99 and 1.11 respectively). The results survive controls for taxes, differential beta risk, transaction costs, and multiple investor types. Basu concludes that P/E ratio information is &quot;not fully reflected in security prices,&quot; constituting a violation of semi-strong form market efficiency. For the EPS project, this paper is foundational: the P/E effect is exactly what the earnings capitalization framework predicts — the earnings yield (E/P) IS the expected return, so high E/P firms should earn higher returns.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Data and Methodology (pp. 663-666)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> All industrial firms listed on the NYSE during the 14-year period April 1957 to March 1971, with fiscal year ending December 31 and continuous price and earnings data. This yields approximately 500-750 firms per year (753 firms total across the period).</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio construction:</strong> At April 1 of each year t, firms are ranked by their P/E ratio as of December 31 of year t-1 (using fiscal year earnings). Five portfolios (A through E) are formed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio A: highest P/E quintile (median P/E = 35.8)</li>
<li>Portfolio B: second highest (median P/E = 19.1)</li>
<li>Portfolio C: middle (median P/E = 15.2)</li>
<li>Portfolio D: fourth (median P/E = 12.8)</li>
<li>Portfolio E: lowest P/E quintile (median P/E = 9.8)</li>
</ul>
<p>Firms with zero or negative earnings are excluded (a methodological choice Basu acknowledges may bias results).</p>
<p><strong>Return measurement:</strong> Monthly returns (dividends + capital appreciation) computed for the 12-month holding period April 1 to March 31. The 3-month lag between fiscal year end and portfolio formation ensures all P/E information is publicly available at portfolio formation date.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark:</strong> Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Jensen's differential return (alpha) measures risk-adjusted performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>δ_p = R̄_p - [R̄_f + β̂_p(R̄_m - R̄_f)]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Returns increase monotonically from high to low P/E (with D and E tied at 13.55%).</li>
<li>Betas are nearly IDENTICAL across portfolios (range: 0.99 to 1.11) — the return differential is NOT explained by systematic risk.</li>
<li>Jensen's alpha is economically and statistically significant at both extremes: -3.3% for high P/E, +4.7% for low P/E.</li>
<li>The spread between A and E is 4.21% in raw returns and 8.0% in risk-adjusted returns.</li>
</ol>
<h3>After-Tax Results (Table 2, p. 669)</h3>
<p>Using Brennan's (1970) after-tax CAPM, results are qualitatively identical. Portfolio E's alpha is +3.9% (t=3.31), Portfolio A's alpha is -3.6% (t=-2.87). Taxes cannot explain the P/E effect.</p>
<h3>Sub-Portfolios by Beta Within P/E Class (Table 3, p. 671)</h3>
<p>Within each P/E quintile, Basu forms two sub-portfolios by beta (high vs. low systematic risk). Key finding: Jensen's delta &quot;tends to be somewhat larger&quot; for the low P/E class across most beta levels, confirming that the P/E effect is not a disguised beta effect. The P/E information adds value AFTER controlling for beta.</p>
<h3>Random Portfolio Test (Table 4, p. 674)</h3>
<p>For each P/E portfolio, 20 random portfolios of equal size are drawn from the full sample (without P/E sorting). These random portfolios have equivalent beta to the P/E-sorted portfolios. Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio E (low P/E) outperforms its random counterparts at the 0.05 level</li>
<li>Portfolio A (high P/E) underperforms its random counterparts at the 0.05 level</li>
<li>Middle portfolios (B, C, D) show no significant difference from random</li>
</ul>
<p>This confirms the P/E effect is not an artifact of portfolio construction methodology.</p>
<h3>Wealth Relatives (Table 5, pp. 676-677)</h3>
<p>&quot;Wealth relatives&quot; compare terminal wealth from P/E portfolios to terminal wealth from random portfolios at each decile of the wealth distribution. At every decile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low P/E (E) dominates its random benchmark</li>
<li>High P/E (A) is dominated by its random benchmark</li>
</ul>
<p>The dominance is consistent across the entire distribution, not driven by outliers.</p>
<h3>Transaction Costs and Four Investor Classes (Table 6, p. 679)</h3>
<p>Basu considers four types of investors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tax-exempt reallocator</strong> (reallocates across P/E quintiles annually): excess return +3.51% after costs</li>
<li><strong>Tax-paying reallocator</strong>: excess return +1.94% after costs</li>
<li><strong>Tax-exempt trader</strong> (switches between low P/E and T-bills based on market timing): excess return +1.08% after costs</li>
<li><strong>Tax-paying trader</strong>: excess return +0.40% after costs</li>
</ol>
<p>The portfolio reallocators (types 1-2) earn economically significant excess returns even after transaction costs. The traders (types 3-4) earn smaller but still positive excess returns. Transaction costs reduce but do not eliminate the P/E effect.</p>
<h3>Interpretation: Market Disequilibria (pp. 680-681)</h3>
<p>Basu's conclusion is carefully stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the P/E ratio information was not 'fully reflected' in security prices in as rapid a manner as postulated by the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notes three possible interpretations: (1) the CAPM is misspecified (omitted risk factors), (2) the P/E ratio proxies for a true risk factor not captured by beta, or (3) the market is genuinely inefficient with respect to P/E information. Basu favors interpretation (3) but acknowledges he cannot definitively rule out (1) or (2).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The P/E Effect IS the Earnings Yield Effect</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, the earnings yield (E/P) is the cost of equity — the expected return on a stock. Basu's finding that high E/P (low P/E) stocks earn higher returns is not an &quot;anomaly&quot; requiring explanation; it is the DEFINITION of earnings-based pricing. If investors price stocks as P = EPS × P/E, then E/P = EPS/P is the yield they earn. High yield means high return. This is exactly what Basu documents.</p>
<h3>2. Beta Does Not Explain Cross-Sectional Returns — But E/P Does</h3>
<p>Basu's most striking finding is that betas are nearly identical across P/E quintiles (0.99 to 1.11), yet returns differ enormously (9.3% to 13.6%). This means the CAPM's risk measure (beta) fails to explain the return variation that the earnings yield explains perfectly. The earnings yield is a better measure of expected returns than beta — exactly as the EPS paradigm claims.</p>
<h3>3. The Spread Is the Earnings Yield Spread</h3>
<p>The 4.2% raw return spread between high and low P/E portfolios (13.55% - 9.34%) corresponds closely to the difference in earnings yields. Portfolio E has a median P/E of 9.8 (E/P ≈ 10.2%), while Portfolio A has a median P/E of 35.8 (E/P ≈ 2.8%). The 7.4% E/P spread maps onto the 4.2% return spread, with the compression reflecting growth (high P/E firms have some growth embedded) and mean reversion (the Molodovsky effect documented by Ou &amp; Penman 1989).</p>
<h3>4. Not a &quot;Behavioral Bias&quot; — A Pricing Framework</h3>
<p>Basu interprets his results as evidence of market &quot;disequilibria&quot; or inefficiency. In the EPS paradigm, there is no inefficiency: the market correctly prices stocks using earnings capitalization, and the earnings yield IS the expected return. The &quot;puzzle&quot; exists only if you assume the CAPM is the correct pricing model and beta is the correct risk measure.</p>
<h3>5. Historical Priority: Pre-Dates Fama-French</h3>
<p>Basu (1977) documents the value premium 15 years before Fama &amp; French (1992) attribute it to HML. The P/E effect is the original &quot;value effect,&quot; and it is explicitly an earnings-based effect — not a book-to-market effect. The EPS paradigm's emphasis on the earnings yield as the cost of equity aligns with Basu's original finding more naturally than the Fama-French factor framework.</p>
<h3>6. Transaction Costs Cannot Eliminate the Effect</h3>
<p>The survival of the P/E effect after transaction costs (Table 6) means it is not merely a theoretical curiosity. Portfolio reallocators earning 2-3.5% excess returns after costs suggests the earnings yield spread is a real, exploitable feature of asset prices — consistent with it being a fundamental pricing relationship rather than a statistical artifact.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Nicholson (1960, 1968)</strong> — Basu cites Nicholson's early work documenting the P/E effect in common stocks. Nicholson's 1960 FAJ article is the earliest systematic study.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — MM's dividend irrelevance assumes markets are efficient. Basu's P/E effect challenges the efficiency assumption that underlies MM.</li>
<li><strong>Ball &amp; Brown (1968)</strong> — Ball &amp; Brown's post-earnings announcement drift is a related earnings-based anomaly. Both show that earnings information is not fully incorporated into prices.</li>
<li><strong>Fama (1970)</strong> — Basu explicitly tests Fama's semi-strong form efficient market hypothesis and rejects it.</li>
<li><strong>Jensen (1968, 1969)</strong> — Basu uses Jensen's measure of portfolio performance (alpha) as the primary test statistic.</li>
<li><strong>Black, Jensen &amp; Scholes (1972)</strong> — The CAPM benchmark model. Basu's results show the CAPM fails to explain P/E-sorted returns.</li>
<li><strong>Brennan (1970)</strong> — Provides the after-tax CAPM used in Table 2.</li>
<li><strong>Basu (1983)</strong> — Basu's follow-up paper in JFE provides further evidence on the relationship between E/P, firm size, and returns, controlling for the size effect (Banz 1981).</li>
<li><strong>Ou &amp; Penman (1989)</strong> — Document the P/E effect and the Molodovsky effect (P/E mean-reversion due to transitory earnings). The P/E effect in Ou &amp; Penman is the same phenomenon Basu documents.</li>
<li><strong>Jaffe, Keim &amp; Westerfield (1989)</strong> — Show E/P predicts returns after controlling for beta, size, and January effects — extending Basu's result.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (1992)</strong> — &quot;The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns&quot; shows beta has no explanatory power for returns after controlling for size and book-to-market. Basu's P/E effect is subsumed by book-to-market in Fama-French, but the EPS paradigm argues this gets the causation backward: the earnings yield is the fundamental pricing variable.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</strong> — Graham &amp; Dodd's value investing framework uses the earnings yield as the measure of cheapness. Basu's low P/E outperformance is the empirical validation of Graham &amp; Dodd's approach.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Basu's P/E effect is the foundational empirical fact for the EPS paradigm's claim that the earnings yield is the cost of equity. If E/P is the expected return, then high E/P stocks should earn higher returns — which is exactly what Basu (1977) documents.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — Basu shows that a backward-looking measure (last year's E/P) predicts forward-looking returns. This is the essence of backward-looking asset pricing: current earnings determine expected returns.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — The earnings yield spread (E/P - rf) can be interpreted as the equity risk premium in the EPS paradigm. Basu's finding that E/P predicts returns supports the view that the ERP is simply the observable spread between the earnings yield and the risk-free rate.</li>
