    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Fama &amp; French's 1993 JFE paper constructs the <strong>three-factor model</strong> for stock returns: R_i - RF = a_i + b_i(RM-RF) + s_i·SMB + h_i·HML + e_i, where SMB (Small Minus Big) captures the size premium and HML (High Minus Low) captures the value premium. The paper shows this three-factor model explains most of the cross-sectional variation in average returns on 25 size-BE/ME portfolios — intercepts are close to zero, meaning size and BE/ME factors capture risk priced by the market. The paper also identifies two bond-market factors — TERM (term premium) and DEF (default premium) — creating a unified five-factor framework linking stock and bond returns. This model became the standard benchmark for asset pricing, performance evaluation, and event studies for two decades.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>From Cross-Section to Time Series (pp. 3-5)</h3>
<p>The 1992 paper showed that size and BE/ME explain the cross-section of average returns. This paper asks: are these patterns driven by <strong>common risk factors</strong> in returns? The approach shifts from Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions to <strong>time-series regressions</strong> in the Black-Jensen-Scholes (1972) tradition.</p>
<p>If the three-factor model is correct, time-series regressions of portfolio excess returns on the three factors should produce intercepts (alphas) of zero.</p>
<h3>Factor Construction (pp. 7-9)</h3>
<p><strong>Size factor — SMB (Small Minus Big):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each June, stocks sorted into Small (below NYSE median ME) and Big (above)</li>
<li>SMB = average return on three small portfolios minus average return on three big portfolios</li>
<li>Average SMB return: 0.27%/month (t = 2.28)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value factor — HML (High Minus Low):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each June, stocks sorted by BE/ME into Low (bottom 30%), Medium (middle 40%), High (top 30%) using NYSE breakpoints</li>
<li>HML = average return on two high-BE/ME portfolios minus average return on two low-BE/ME portfolios</li>
<li>Average HML return: 0.40%/month (t = 2.91) ≈ 4.8%/year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market factor — RM-RF:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Value-weighted return on all stocks minus one-month T-bill rate</li>
<li>Average: 0.43%/month (t = 1.76)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bond factors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TERM = long-term government bond return minus T-bill rate (term structure premium)</li>
<li>DEF = long-term corporate bond return minus long-term government bond return (default premium)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 25 Test Portfolios (pp. 9-11)</h3>
<p>Dependent variables: 25 portfolios formed from independent sorts on size (5 quintiles) × BE/ME (5 quintiles). These create a wide spread in average returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smallest size, highest BE/ME: 1.72%/month</li>
<li>Largest size, lowest BE/ME: 0.89%/month</li>
<li>Spread provides a demanding test of the model</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stock-Market Results (Tables 3-6, pp. 14-24)</h3>
<p><strong>Market factor alone (CAPM):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intercepts are large and systematically related to size and BE/ME</li>
<li>CAPM leaves 46-172 basis points/month unexplained</li>
<li>The CAPM fails dramatically for these portfolios</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three-factor model (RM-RF + SMB + HML):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intercepts shrink dramatically — most are within 10-20 basis points of zero</li>
<li>R² values: 0.83 to 0.97</li>
<li>SMB loadings (s) decrease from small to big; HML loadings (h) increase from low to high BE/ME</li>
<li><strong>The three-factor model &quot;works&quot; — it captures the size and value patterns that the CAPM misses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Key regression: For the smallest-size, highest-BE/ME portfolio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R - RF = -0.02 + 1.03(RM-RF) + 1.46·SMB + 0.71·HML</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intercept of -0.02 (essentially zero) means the three factors explain the high average return of this extreme portfolio.</p>
<h3>Bond-Market Results (Tables 7-8, pp. 24-31)</h3>
<ul>
<li>TERM and DEF explain time-series variation in bond returns</li>
<li>These bond factors also enter significantly in stock-return regressions (especially for small and low-grade firms)</li>
<li>Stock and bond markets share common risk factors through the term structure</li>
<li>When TERM and DEF are added to stock regressions, they are significant but do not displace SMB and HML</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Integrated Model (pp. 31-36)</h3>
<p>The five-factor model for stocks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R_i - RF = a_i + b_i(RM-RF) + s_i·SMB + h_i·HML + m_i·TERM + n_i·DEF + e_i</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stock and bond returns share common exposure to TERM and DEF, establishing a link between equity and fixed-income risk pricing. However, for stock portfolios, the three stock-market factors dominate.</p>
<h3>Rational Risk Interpretation (pp. 4-5, 37-41)</h3>
<p>Fama &amp; French interpret the factors as state variables in an ICAPM (Merton 1973):</p>
<ul>
<li>SMB and HML are <strong>mimicking portfolios</strong> for underlying risk factors related to size and distress</li>
<li>High BE/ME firms are financially distressed → their stocks are risky in ways beta doesn't capture</li>
<li>Small firms face greater uncertainty about future earnings → additional risk</li>
<li>The factors earn positive premiums because investors demand compensation for bearing these risks</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the <strong>rational</strong> interpretation: the market is efficient, and the three-factor model captures risk that the CAPM misses.</p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Standard Asset Pricing Model (1993-2015)</h3>
<p>The Fama-French three-factor model became THE benchmark for empirical asset pricing. Every event study, performance evaluation, and anomaly test used it. Jensen's alpha (from CAPM) was replaced by Fama-French alpha (from the three-factor model). This was the standard for over two decades until Fama-French (2015) added profitability and investment factors.</p>
<h3>2. Value and Size as &quot;Risk Factors&quot;</h3>
<p>By constructing SMB and HML as tradeable factors and showing they explain the cross-section, Fama &amp; French transformed the anomaly literature. What were previously &quot;anomalies&quot; (size effect, value effect) became &quot;risk factors&quot; — systematic sources of return that investors are compensated for bearing. Whether these truly represent risk or mispricing remains debated.</p>
<h3>3. The Bridge Between APT and Practice</h3>
<p>Ross's APT (1976) said multiple factors matter but didn't say which ones. Fama-French (1993) provided specific, empirically grounded factors. This made the APT practical and testable, bridging abstract theory and empirical implementation.</p>
<h3>4. The Factor Zoo Problem</h3>
<p>By demonstrating that ad hoc factors can explain cross-sectional returns, Fama-French opened the door to hundreds of proposed factors — momentum (Carhart 1997), profitability, investment, quality, low volatility, etc. Harvey, Liu &amp; Zhu (2016) documented 316 factors in the literature. The &quot;factor zoo&quot; is both a triumph of the Fama-French methodology and a cautionary tale about data mining.</p>
<h3>5. Passive Factor Investing</h3>
<p>The three-factor model showed that &quot;alpha&quot; from the CAPM was often just exposure to size and value factors. This led to factor-based investing strategies — &quot;smart beta&quot; — where investors could capture size and value premiums through passive, low-cost portfolios. DFA (Dimensional Fund Advisors), where Fama serves as director, commercialized this approach.</p>
