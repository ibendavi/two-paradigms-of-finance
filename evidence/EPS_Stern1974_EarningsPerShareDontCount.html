    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Joel Stern's 1974 <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em> article is a polemical attack on EPS as a criterion for corporate financial decisions, written from the perspective of a practitioner-turned-academic (VP at Chase Manhattan Bank, columnist for the Financial Times and Commercial and Financial Chronicle, adjunct professor at Wisconsin). The paper's most memorable contribution is the &quot;AB-BA Fallacy&quot; in M&amp;A: if Company A (P/E = 20) buys Company B (P/E = 10), the combined AB's EPS exceeds A's original — so the deal appears EPS-accretive for A's shareholders. But if B buys A, the combined BA's EPS exceeds B's original — so the deal ALSO appears accretive for B's shareholders. Both can't be right; the fallacy is using EPS accretion as the criterion. Beyond M&amp;A, Stern argues that EPS &quot;confuses investment with financing&quot; — a bad investment can be made to appear good by levering it up, since debt financing increases EPS whenever the after-tax return on capital exceeds the after-tax interest rate. His alternative: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) model, which discounts earnings NET of the capital required to sustain growth. FCF = NOPAT - I (net operating profit after taxes minus new investment). The six variables: (1) NOPAT, (2) expected investment I, (3) cost of capital c*, (4) capitalized tax saving tD, (5) return on new investment r, (6) time horizon T. The key insight: two firms with identical earnings growth but different capital intensity should have different prices because the capital-intensive firm requires more reinvestment, leaving less free cash flow. EPS treats them the same. This paper is essentially the earliest published version of Stern's later EVA (Economic Value Added) framework and the intellectual ancestor of the DCF/FCF valuation approach that became dominant in academia and consulting. For the EPS project, Stern (1974) represents the moment when a Wall Street practitioner adopted the academic critique of EPS and attempted to bring DCF thinking to the practitioner audience — yet 50 years later, EPS remains the dominant metric.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The AB-BA Fallacy (p. 39)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Company A has P/E = 20, Company B has P/E = 10.</p>
<p><strong>A buys B:</strong> &quot;If A uses its shares to buy B and form a new company AB, the new company's EPS will always exceed A's.&quot; Why? A is buying earnings cheaply — for each dollar of B's earnings, A gives up shares worth only 75 cents of its own earnings. The &quot;earnings leverage&quot; makes the deal appear EPS-accretive for A.</p>
<p><strong>B buys A:</strong> &quot;However, if the example is turned around, the danger of using EPS becomes obvious. If B buys A to form BA, B will pay at least A's PE of 20. But now BA's EPS will be less than B's because the company with the lower PE must offer more shares per dollar of acquired earnings.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The contradiction:</strong> &quot;The same people who tell us that AB is good for A's and B's shareholders tell us that BA is bad for B's shareholders, even though AB and BA are the same company, most often with the same assets and earnings expectations and, even, the same management.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The resolution:</strong> &quot;A's acquisition of B or B's acquisition of A is in fact good for the buyer's shareholders only if synergism is expected. And the synergism must be at least large enough to justify the premium paid above the seller's current share price.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>On IBM:</strong> &quot;Thus it is illogical to claim that IBM, for instance, can afford to pay more for B than could Chase Manhattan Bank simply because IBM sells at a much higher PE than The Chase. Furthermore, if IBM (or any company selling at a high PE) were to acquire firms for which it paid full value (i.e., for which there was no added benefit to the buyer's shareholders), all the evidence suggests that IBM's PE would fall to offset the gain in EPS.&quot;</p>
<h3>Confusing Investment with Financing (pp. 39-40)</h3>
<p><strong>The anecdote:</strong> &quot;In a recent case, the president of a well-diversified manufacturer selling at 16 times earnings wanted to acquire a small, but exceptionally profitable, electronics manufacturer for a PE of 25. Since an equity swap would 'dilute' the pro forma EPS, we suggested, somewhat facetiously, that it sell itself to the electronics firm, even though the latter was only a tenth the size of the manufacturer, so that the EPS would rise.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The leverage trap:</strong> &quot;Since EPS can be enhanced simply by employing debt, a bad investment often can be made to appear good merely by levering the firm sufficiently to increase the EPS at the time the investment is undertaken.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental error:</strong> &quot;Investment decisions must be made independently of financing decisions, or, in other words, on the basis of considerations other than the effect on EPS. Since EPS is calculated by dividing net profit after taxes and financing costs by the number of shares outstanding, basing investment decisions on EPS unfortunately implies that a specific source of funds finances a specific use of funds, which conceptually is wrong.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Real Benefits of Debt Financing (pp. 40-42)</h3>
<p><strong>The EPS view of debt:</strong> &quot;Depending on the PE multiple, mechanical reliance on PE can encourage expansion of debt to cover dubious projects, or the elimination of all debt by issuing common shares.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The accretion condition:</strong> &quot;A company can use debt to increase its EPS as long as its after-tax return on fixed capital (i.e., all interest-bearing debt and equity) is larger than its after-tax interest costs. Today high-grade bonds cost the firm less than four per cent after taxes. Thus corporate investments in new plant and equipment and working capital that yield more than four per cent after taxes would appear desirable to analysts emphasizing EPS.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The mirror for high-P/E firms:</strong> &quot;The EPS criterion would dictate that high PE firms should issue shares to retire debt. It works out mathematically that EPS can be increased by issuing equity to retire debt so long as the PE is larger than the reciprocal of the after-tax borrowing rate. If a company's after-tax cost of borrowed funds is four per cent, the reciprocal is one divided by four per cent, or 25. Whenever the PE exceeds 25, management can increase EPS simply by issuing equity to retire debt.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What REALLY drives debt's value:</strong> &quot;Actually there is considerable evidence that debt financing does add to the market price of a firm's common shares. The reason is that part of the increase in relative risk due to the fixed interest expense is borne by the federal government — up to 48 per cent, the corporate income tax rate... The real benefit of debt financing to the common shareholders is not the added EPS; it is the government tax saving.&quot;</p>
<h3>EPS Doesn't Count (p. 42)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Clearly an EPS criterion frequently misallocates valuable corporate resources and shortchanges the shareholders. Nor, to judge by market behavior, is EPS the criterion that impresses investors, especially the sophisticated investors who really determine share prices.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The FCF insight:</strong> &quot;Investors do not simply discount earnings per se. Consider two companies, X and Y. Assume that, from all we know, they are the same in every way and that their profits are expected to increase at identical annual rates of 15 per cent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, with the addition of one other piece of information about the two companies, we must conclude that X would command the greater market price. Assume we learn that X requires almost no investment in new capital to increase its profits 15 per cent annually, whereas Y requires a dollar of additional capital for each incremental dollar of sales.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The implication:</strong> &quot;Investors do not simply discount anticipated earnings; rather they discount anticipated earnings net of the amount of capital required to be invested in order to maintain an expected rate of growth in profits. We shall refer to the latter stream as the expected future 'Free Cash Flow.'&quot;</p>
<h3>The Six Variables of the FCF Model (pp. 67-68)</h3>
<p><strong>(1) NOPAT</strong> — Expected net operating profit after taxes. &quot;Profits before financing costs, but after the provision for taxes to be paid on such profits, normalized to exclude temporary distortions.&quot; NOPAT is unaffected by financial leverage.</p>
<p><strong>(2) I</strong> — Expected new investment. &quot;The expected amount of net fixed capital additions which will be required to produce the expected NOPAT.&quot; Defined as the increase in total assets minus the increase in non-interest-bearing current liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>(3) c</strong>* — The cost of capital for business risk. &quot;The market's discount rate for NOPAT, if the company is unlevered (debt-free). It represents the rate of return investors could hope to earn through dividends and capital appreciation by investing elsewhere in the common shares of alternative, identically risky securities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>(4) tD</strong> — The capitalized tax saving for interest-bearing debt. Equal to the marginal corporate income tax rate (t) multiplied by the amount of interest-bearing debt (D) in the market's estimate of the target capital structure.</p>
<p><strong>(5) r</strong> — The after-tax rate of return management is expected to earn on new investment. &quot;For a single investment, the expected rate of return is the rate that discounts the expected future FCF back to the original cash outlay for the project.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>(6) T</strong> — The time horizon for which the market has confidence that r &gt; c*. &quot;Only growth companies can command high PE's, because only if r exceeds c* will management be capable of outperforming the expected returns investors could hope to earn elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<h3>Free Cash Flow and Growth (pp. 67-69)</h3>
<p><strong>FCF = NOPAT - I</strong></p>
<p><strong>FCF Growth Rate = r x (I/NOPAT)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive FCF:</strong> When I &lt; NOPAT (investment rate &lt; 100%). Growth rate = r x (I/NOPAT). Example: NOPAT = $100,000, I = $80,000, r = 15%. Growth = 0.15 x 0.80 = 12%. FCF starts positive at $20,000 and grows at 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Zero FCF:</strong> When I = NOPAT (investment rate = 100%). Growth rate = r x 1.0 = 15%. FCF = 0 during growth period. But NOPAT compounds faster, so terminal value is larger.</li>
<li><strong>Negative FCF:</strong> When I &gt; NOPAT (investment rate &gt; 100%). Growth rate = r x 1.20 = 18%. FCF is negative during growth period. But NOPAT compounds even faster, and terminal value exceeds the zero and positive FCF cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counterintuitive result:</strong> The negative FCF firm has the HIGHEST market value because it has the most investment opportunities earning above the cost of capital. &quot;The resulting market value in the case of the negative FCF exceeds the market value of the zero FCF case for the same reason that the market value of the zero FCF case exceeds the market value of the positive FCF case: There are more investment opportunities expected to earn 15 per cent.&quot;</p>
<h3>Implementing the FCF Model (pp. 70-75)</h3>
<p><strong>Two-stage valuation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 1 (Growth horizon, years 1-T):</strong> Discount anticipated FCF at c* during the period when r &gt; c*.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2 (Expansion, years T+1 to forever):</strong> After growth ceases (r = c*), FCF = NOPAT in perpetuity. Discount at c*.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tables I and II:</strong> Present value factors for FCF during years 1-15 (Table I) and for FCF = NOPAT from year 16 to forever (Table II), with growth rates from 0% to 25% and cost of capital from 6% to 15%.</p>
<p><strong>Determining T:</strong> &quot;The value of T is a function of monetary policy, the degree of government regulation and cyclicality of a company's product line and the state of a firm's replaceable technology.&quot; High regulation, low cyclicality, and strong patent position yield T of at least 15 years.</p>
<h3>Market Efficiency as Foundation (pp. 42-43)</h3>
<p>Stern explicitly grounds his FCF model in the efficient market hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In an efficient market, sophisticated investors perform an extremely useful function. Their activities assure that fair prices and market prices are almost always the same. By attempting to estimate a firm's expected future FCF, they often pursue information in the hope that they will be the first to learn, and thus benefit from it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Although some investors may be misled by such factors as EPS, sophisticated investors who dominate securities markets are not fooled for very long, if they are fooled at all.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The AB-BA Fallacy — The Classic Reductio Against EPS in M&amp;A</h3>
<p>The AB-BA Fallacy is perhaps the most elegant argument against EPS accretion as an M&amp;A criterion. If the same two firms merge, the deal looks accretive regardless of who is the buyer — proving that EPS accretion tells you nothing about value creation. This argument was influential (it appears in many subsequent textbooks) but, as Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024) show, practitioners continue to use EPS accretion as a criterion 50 years later.</p>
<h3>2. A Wall Street Practitioner Adopting the Academic View</h3>
<p>Stern's position is unusual: he is a Chase Manhattan Bank VP arguing that Wall Street's favorite metric is useless. This is an important data point for the maxEPS paradigm paper's intellectual history — it shows that the academic critique of EPS was actively promoted to practitioners by at least the early 1970s, yet failed to change practice.</p>
<h3>3. The Precursor to EVA/Stern Stewart</h3>
<p>The FCF model presented here — with its emphasis on NOPAT minus investment, return on invested capital vs. cost of capital, and free cash flow as the &quot;real&quot; driver of value — is the intellectual ancestor of Economic Value Added (EVA), which Stern later commercialized through Stern Stewart &amp; Co. (founded 1982). The EVA framework became extremely influential in consulting but, as Almeida (2019) documents, never displaced EPS as the dominant corporate metric.</p>
<h3>4. The Accretion Condition — Described and Criticized</h3>
<p>Stern explicitly derives the condition under which debt increases EPS: after-tax return on capital &gt; after-tax interest rate. And the condition under which equity issuance increases EPS: P/E &gt; 1/r_d(1-T_c). These are the same conditions that Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014) and Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006) later test empirically. Stern knew the conditions in 1974 and argued they were irrelevant; the empirical literature shows they drive actual behavior.</p>
<h3>5. The Capital Intensity Argument Against EPS</h3>
<p>The X vs. Y example — two firms with identical earnings growth but different capital requirements — is Stern's most substantive argument. EPS treats them the same; FCF/market value treats them differently. This is valid within the NPV framework but reveals an interesting feature of the EPS paradigm: if investors price using P = EPS x P/E, and if the P/E multiples of X and Y differ to reflect capital intensity, the EPS paradigm may handle this through the multiple rather than through the earnings.</p>
<h3>6. The Negative-FCF Firm Paradox</h3>
<p>Stern's finding that the negative-FCF firm has the HIGHEST market value (because it has the most investment opportunities) is important theoretically but creates a practical problem: how do you value a firm with negative free cash flow? The EPS paradigm handles this more naturally — the firm has positive EPS and a high P/E reflecting growth expectations. The FCF model requires discounting a stream that is negative for many years.</p>
<h3>7. &quot;Sophisticated Investors&quot; — The Efficient Market Assumption</h3>
<p>Like Pringle (1973), Stern's entire argument rests on market efficiency: &quot;sophisticated investors who dominate securities markets are not fooled for very long, if they are fooled at all.&quot; If this assumption fails — if investors DO price using EPS multiples — then the EPS paradigm describes reality even if it is theoretically suboptimal.</p>
<h3>8. The Teaching Analogy — 50 Years of Failure</h3>
<p>Stern (1974) was an attempt to change practitioner behavior through education. Almeida (2019) proposes exactly the same strategy 45 years later. The persistence of EPS maximization despite decades of academic critique suggests that this is not a problem that education alone can solve — which supports the EPS paradigm's view that EPS maximization is a robust business method, not an error to be corrected.</p>

<li><strong>Pringle (1973)</strong> — &quot;Price Earnings Ratios, Earnings-Per-Share, and Financial Management.&quot; Published one year earlier, making many of the same arguments from a purely academic perspective. Stern adds the AB-BA Fallacy and the FCF model.</li>
<li><strong>Stern (1972)</strong> — &quot;Let's Abandon Earnings Per Share.&quot; <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, December 18, 1972. Cited as reference [13] in Pringle (1973). The WSJ editorial that preceded this longer FAJ treatment.</li>

<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — Stern's argument that debt's value comes from tax shields (not added EPS) is directly from MM with taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Andrade (1997)</strong> — &quot;Do Appearances Matter?&quot; Tests whether EPS accretion drives acquirer stock prices in M&amp;A — exactly the behavior Stern's AB-BA Fallacy criticizes.</li>
<li><strong>Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2024)</strong> — &quot;EPS Sensitivity and Merger Deals.&quot; Show that deals are structured around EPS accretion/dilution — the practice Stern attacked in 1974 is empirically confirmed 50 years later.</li>
<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; Formalize and test the same accretion condition Stern describes (E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) determines when equity is &quot;expensive&quot; in EPS terms).</li>
<li><strong>Almeida (2019)</strong> — &quot;Is It Time to Get Rid of Earnings-per-Share (EPS)?&quot; The intellectual successor to Stern (1974). Almeida cites the same problems (EPS distorts M&amp;A, capital allocation, investment) and proposes the same solution (stop using EPS). The 45-year gap between the two papers, with no change in practice, is itself evidence for the EPS paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> — Survey evidence that managers still care deeply about EPS benchmarks, 31 years after Stern argued EPS &quot;doesn't count.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Stern's paper is the earliest attempt by a practitioner-academic to displace EPS with a DCF/FCF framework. The fact that this attempt failed — that EPS remains the dominant metric for compensation (Huang et al. 2014: 44.8%), M&amp;A (Dasgupta et al. 2024: 309,505 Factiva mentions), and payout (Brav et al. 2005: 76.1% say EPS important for repurchases) — is strong evidence that EPS maximization is not an error to be educated away but a stable equilibrium.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Stern (1974) is a landmark in the intellectual history: the moment when the most sophisticated version of the anti-EPS argument (complete with FCF model, present-value tables, and the AB-BA Fallacy) was presented to the practitioner audience. The failure of this argument to change practice over five decades provides the strongest evidence that EPS maximization is a paradigm, not a mistake.</li>
