    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Garvey, Milbourne &amp; Xie's 2013 working paper develops an algorithm that predicts merger targets based on EPS accretion. For any pair of firms in the same 2-digit SIC industry, they compute whether an all-stock acquisition (with a 20% premium) would be EPS-accretive to the higher-P/E buyer. Their key variable, &quot;Accretive Bidders&quot; (the number of industry peers that could make an EPS-accretive acquisition of a given firm), strongly predicts which firms become takeover targets. Moving from the median to the maximum number of Accretive Bidders increases the probability of being a target by 85% (from 3.4% to 6.3%, marginal effect = 0.058). This EPS-based measure dominates alternative measures based on book value (coefficient 0.016) and residual income model valuation (coefficient 0.034). The authors also show that: (1) the likelihood of being an acquirer is predicted by the number of viable targets available, (2) the number of Accretive Bidders predicts industry-level merger waves with R² of 0.79-0.82, (3) more viable targets predict the use of stock as a method of payment, and (4) results are robust to varying acquisition premia (10%-200%). Using I/B/E/S analyst forecast EPS produces stronger results than historical earnings, consistent with the EPS paradigm's emphasis on forward-looking EPS. For the EPS project, this paper provides direct evidence that M&amp;A activity is driven by the EPS accretion/dilution motive — exactly the mechanism described in the EPS paradigm paper.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 1-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Central premise:</strong> When deciding whether to acquire a target, managers ask &quot;What will it do for my EPS?&quot; If paying with stock, the deal is EPS-accretive to the buyer when the buyer's P/E ratio exceeds the target's P/E ratio (after accounting for the acquisition premium). This &quot;bootstrap game&quot; — acquiring low-P/E firms to boost EPS — has been discussed since the 1960s merger wave but never formally tested as a predictor of merger activity.</p>
<p><strong>The Shleifer-Vishny (2003) framework:</strong> Shleifer &amp; Vishny model stock-financed acquisitions as driven by relative overvaluation — rational managers of overvalued firms use their inflated stock to buy real assets. Garvey et al. note that an overvalued acquirer (high P/E) buying an undervalued target (low P/E) is mechanically the same as an EPS-accretive stock deal. Their contribution is making this P/E-based criterion operational and testing it.</p>
<p><strong>The key distinction:</strong> Are acquirers trying to increase their EPS (the &quot;bootstrap&quot; story), increase their book value, or increase their intrinsic value? The paper tests all three and finds EPS dominates.</p>
<h3>Section 2: Hypothesis Development (pp. 6-10)</h3>
<p><strong>The EPS accretion condition (Eq. 1):</strong></p>
<p>For a stock deal with acquisition premium δ, the deal is EPS-accretive to the buyer if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P/E_buyer &gt; (1 + δ) × P/E_target</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With δ = 20% (the paper's baseline), the buyer needs a P/E at least 20% higher than the target's.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of &quot;viable buyer&quot; (Eq. 2-3):</strong></p>
<p>A firm j is a &quot;viable buyer&quot; of firm i if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both firms are in the same 2-digit SIC industry</li>
<li>Firm j's market cap exceeds firm i's market cap</li>
<li>The all-stock deal (with 20% premium) is EPS-accretive: ForecastEPS_j / P_j &lt; ForecastEPS_i / [(1+δ) × P_i]</li>
</ol>
<p>This is equivalent to: the buyer's earnings yield &lt; the target's earnings yield / (1+δ).</p>
<p><strong>Three measures of viable buyers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accretive Bidders:</strong> based on I/B/E/S forecast EPS (forward P/E)</li>
<li><strong>Book Bidders:</strong> based on book value — deal is &quot;accretive&quot; if target's P/B &lt; buyer's P/B</li>
<li><strong>RIM Bidders:</strong> based on residual income model intrinsic value — deal is &quot;accretive&quot; if target trades below RIM value</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two hypotheses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>H1: The likelihood of being a takeover target is increasing in the number of viable buyers</li>
<li>H2: Stock payment is more likely when there are more viable targets for the acquirer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 3: Data and Methodology (pp. 10-18)</h3>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> Compustat + SDC Platinum + I/B/E/S, 1981-2012. After filters: 7,367 target firm-years, 7,404 acquirer firm-years, 127,188 non-merger firm-year observations.</p>

<p>Target firms have substantially more Accretive Bidders (median 83) than non-merger firms (median 50) — they are in a richer &quot;EPS accretion opportunity set.&quot; Target firms also have lower forward P/E (14.43 vs. 15.96 for non-mergers), meaning they offer more EPS accretion potential.</p>

<p><strong>The EPS-based measure dominates.</strong> The coefficient on Accretive Bidders (0.058) is nearly 4x that of Book Bidders (0.016). When all three are included together, Accretive Bidders retains a coefficient of 0.042, still the largest. The 0.058 marginal effect means: for a firm with average attributes, moving from the median to the maximum number of Accretive Bidders increases the target probability from 3.4% to 6.3% — an 85% increase.</p>
<p>Other controls: prior industry takeover activity increases target likelihood; P/E increases it; leverage is negatively related but insignificant; firm size has a nonlinear relationship.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Predicting acquirers (Table 3):</strong></p>
<p>The number of Accretive Targets predicts being a bidder (coefficient 0.032, sig at 1%). However, once P/FE is added as a control, the Accretive Targets variable becomes insignificant — the P/FE ratio subsumes it. &quot;Firms with high price earnings ratios are more likely to be an acquirer, and this effect subsumes our measure's predictive effect.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rhodes-Kropf misvaluation measures are MORE important for predicting acquirers than for predicting targets — overvalued firms (high P/E relative to fundamentals) are more likely to acquire.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Merger activity at firm and industry levels (Tables 4-5):</strong></p>
<p>At the firm level: both Accretive Bidders and Accretive Targets are positive and significant at 1% for predicting whether a firm is involved in ANY merger (as target or acquirer).</p>
<p>At the industry level (Table 5): &quot;Ind Average Accretive Bidders&quot; (the average number of Accretive Bidders across all firms in an industry-year) predicts industry-level merger waves. This variable is consistently positive and significant at 1% across all specifications, controlling for number of firms, industry M/B, Rhodes-Kropf measures, and lagged merger activity.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1, Panel A — Aggregate merger activity:</strong></p>
<p>OLS regressions of total number of takeovers per year on the median number of Accretive Bidders. R² = 0.79-0.82. Coefficient on Median Num Accretive Bidders (lagged) = 9.05-9.92 (t = 7.12-7.46). This shows that the economy-wide count of EPS-accretive opportunities explains nearly 80% of the variation in aggregate merger activity.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Predicting medium of exchange (Table 6a-6b):</strong></p>
<p>Stock-only payment is positively related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target Accretive Bidders (more viable EPS-accretive buyers → more stock deals)</li>
<li>Target Accretive Targets (more viable EPS-accretive targets → more stock deals)</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic significance: moving from the median to the maximum number of viable targets increases the probability of 100% stock payment by 20%.</p>
<p>At the industry level, Industry Average Accretive Bidders also predicts stock usage.</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Horizontal mergers (Table 7):</strong></p>
<p>Results are positive when controlling only for year effects, but become insignificant with industry fixed effects. Horizontal mergers are driven more by industry shocks (deregulation, technology) than by P/E dispersion.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 Sensitivity to acquisition premium (Table 8):</strong></p>
<p>Results robust to premia of 10%, 50%, 100%, and 200%. The count of viable bidders naturally declines with higher premia, but the distribution of P/E ratios within industries is sufficiently dispersed (and bimodal) that even doubling the premium &quot;only cuts in half&quot; the number of viable bidders.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Conclusion (pp. 29)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We find that the likelihood of being a target is positively related to the number of viable buyers for the firm, and that the likelihood of observing stock as a method of payment is positively related to the number of viable buyers for each target and the number of stock targets for each acquirer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors note that the EPS-based, book-based, and RIM-based measures are correlated, so they cannot fully distinguish whether managers are maximizing EPS, book value, or intrinsic value. However, the EPS measure consistently has the largest coefficient.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Direct Test of EPS Accretion as a Merger Motive</h3>
<p>This paper operationalizes and tests the central claim of the EPS paradigm regarding M&amp;A: that managers acquire firms to boost EPS. The &quot;Accretive Bidders&quot; variable is a direct measure of the EPS accretion opportunity available to a firm. Its strong predictive power for merger targets, acquirers, merger waves, and payment method is evidence that EPS accretion drives M&amp;A decisions.</p>
<h3>2. EPS-Based Measure Dominates Book-Value and RIM Measures</h3>
<p>The coefficient on Accretive Bidders (0.058) is nearly 4x that of Book Bidders (0.016), confirming that managers care more about EPS accretion than about book-value accretion or intrinsic-value accretion. This is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts: the relevant question is &quot;will this deal boost my EPS?&quot;, not &quot;will this deal increase my book value?&quot; or &quot;will this deal create NPV?&quot;</p>
<h3>3. Forward-Looking EPS Matters Most — Consistent with P = E(EPS) x P/E</h3>
<p>The use of I/B/E/S analyst forecast EPS (rather than trailing EPS) to compute Accretive Bidders is significant. The paper notes that forward P/E produces stronger results than historical measures. In the EPS paradigm, P = E(EPS) x P/E, where E(EPS) is the analyst consensus forecast. The finding that forecast-based measures predict merger activity better than historical measures confirms the role of expected (not reported) EPS.</p>
<h3>4. P/E Dispersion Drives Merger Waves</h3>
<p>The aggregate result — that the median number of Accretive Bidders explains 79-82% of the variation in annual merger activity — connects EPS accretion to merger waves. In the EPS paradigm, merger waves occur when P/E dispersion within industries is high: high-P/E firms can make EPS-accretive acquisitions of low-P/E firms. When P/E dispersion contracts (e.g., in recessions), the accretion opportunity disappears and merger activity declines.</p>
<h3>5. Stock Payment Is the Vehicle for the Bootstrap Game</h3>
<p>The finding that stock payment increases with the number of viable targets confirms the classic &quot;bootstrap&quot; mechanism: high-P/E firms use their &quot;expensive&quot; stock to buy low-P/E firms, boosting their EPS. This is the M&amp;A version of the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction: managers issue equity when the earnings yield is low (stock is &quot;cheap&quot; to issue).</p>
<h3>6. P/FE Subsumes the Acquirer Prediction</h3>
<p>The finding that P/FE subsumes the Accretive Targets variable in predicting acquirers is important: a high P/E (low earnings yield) is the necessary condition for EPS-accretive acquisitions. In the EPS paradigm, a high P/E firm has &quot;expensive equity&quot; — its earnings yield is low — and can boost EPS by using that expensive stock to buy higher-yielding (lower P/E) assets.</p>
<h3>7. Target Firms Have Lower P/E and More Potential Buyers</h3>
<p>Target firms have median P/FE of 14.43 vs. 15.96 for non-merger firms, and many more Accretive Bidders (83 vs. 50). This confirms the EPS paradigm's prediction: firms become targets when their earnings yield is HIGH (P/E is low) relative to potential acquirers, because the acquisition would be EPS-accretive to more buyers.</p>
<h3>8. The Algorithm Is Operational — Managers Can (and Do) Use It</h3>
<p>The paper's algorithm is essentially a formalization of what investment bankers do: screen for targets where the buyer's P/E exceeds the target's P/E by enough to absorb the premium. The fact that this simple screen predicts actual mergers confirms that practitioners operate within the EPS accretion framework.</p>
