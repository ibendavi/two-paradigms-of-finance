    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Hickman's 1958 NBER monograph is the definitive empirical study of corporate bond quality in the United States, covering $71.5 billion in straight bond offerings from 1900 to 1943. The study's most remarkable finding: the net loss rate on the entire universe of corporate bonds was ZERO — promised yields (5.3%) and realized yields (5.4%) were virtually identical, meaning that on aggregate, the risk premiums embedded in bond yields exactly compensated for default losses. Low-grade bonds earned higher realized returns than high-grade bonds over long periods, but with much greater variability. Chapter 7 demonstrates that the times-charges-earned ratio (the number of times fixed charges are covered by earnings) is &quot;by all odds the most popular measure of earnings coverage&quot; and is a powerful predictor of default: bonds with fixed charges earned 3.0+ times had a default rate of only 3.4%, versus 42.9% for bonds with charges earned less than 1.0 times. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's minimum coverage standards are cited and validated. For the EPS project, this study documents that earnings-based measures (earnings coverage ratios) were the primary tools used by investors, rating agencies, and legal lists to assess credit quality throughout the first half of the twentieth century — a world of earnings-based analysis, not discounted cash flow.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Scope and Coverage (pp. 5, 7, 28-33)</h3>
<p>The study covers the universe of straight corporate bonds offered during 1900-1943, including those outstanding on January 1, 1900. &quot;Straight&quot; means fixed-coupon, single-maturity bonds (excluding income bonds, serial issues, and equipment obligations). Coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total par amount:</strong> $71.5 billion offered, 1900-1943</li>
<li><strong>Large issues</strong> (≥$5 million total offering): all included; $56.6 billion (79.1%)</li>
<li><strong>Small issues</strong> (&lt;$5 million): representative 10% sample; $14.9 billion (20.9%)</li>
<li><strong>Industries:</strong> Railroads, public utilities (electric, gas, telephone, telegraph, street railways, water, miscellaneous), industrials (manufacturing, service, trade, mining)</li>
<li><strong>Excluded:</strong> Financial corporations, real estate mortgage bonds, government obligations, foreign-currency issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Four Measures of Investor Experience (pp. 6-7, 41-43)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Default rate:</strong> Proportion of par amount going into default at any time between offering and extinguishment</li>
<li><strong>Promised yield:</strong> Yield to maturity assuming full payment — the yield investors expected at purchase</li>
<li><strong>Realized yield:</strong> Actual yield computed from all cash receipts (coupons, principal, call premiums, default recoveries) — accounts for defaults, calls, and actual timing</li>
<li><strong>Loss rate:</strong> Realized yield minus promised yield — the retrospective cost of default risk. Positive = capital loss; negative = capital gain</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Central Finding: Net Loss Rate = Zero (pp. 7-8)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The weighted average promised and realized yields on total offerings both worked out at 5.6 percent [elsewhere stated as 5.3% promised, 5.4% realized], so that for the universe of corporate bonds the net loss rate was zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 93% that were regular offerings: 12% paid in full at maturity, 37% were called, 18% defaulted, and 26% were still outstanding on January 1, 1944 with a perfect contractual record. The zero loss rate on issues paid in full at maturity (realized yield equaled promised yield) and the capital gains from called bonds (called at a premium) exactly offset the losses on defaulted bonds.</p>
<p>On defaulted issues: the average life-span loss rate was 3.7%. But the remarkable fact is that capital losses on defaulted issues were just offset by capital gains on irregular offerings and on regular offerings called or selling in 1944 above amortized book value.</p>

<p>Key pattern: loss rates are near zero or NEGATIVE across almost every quality category. The market priced bonds so that promised yields slightly overcompensated for default losses.</p>
<h3>Low-Grade Bonds Earned Higher Returns (pp. 14-15)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;On the average and over long periods, the life-span yields realized on high-grade corporate bonds were below those on low-grade bonds, with the result that investors, in the aggregate, obtained better returns on the low grades.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The higher promised returns exacted on the low grades at offering proved to be more than sufficient to offset the higher default losses, so that life-span yields realized on low grades were higher than on high grades. This finding would later influence Milken's junk bond revolution in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Important qualification: &quot;this finding emerges only when broad aggregates of corporate bonds are considered over long investment periods.&quot; Individual investors over short periods faced much greater dispersion. Small investors and those seeking liquidity fared best with high-grade bonds.</p>
<h3>Bonds Undervalued at Default (pp. 19-20)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Corporate bonds were typically undervalued in the market at or near the date of default. As a result, investors selling at that time suffered large losses, while those purchasing obtained correspondingly large gains.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The average yield promised at offering on all large corporate bonds that went into default was 6.4%, versus a yield realized from offering to default of minus 3.4%. Investors who bought at default earned 20% per annum on average, because default prices were &quot;unduly depressed&quot; — many financial intermediaries were forced to sell at default by their directors or regulatory authorities.</p>
<h3>Secular and Cyclical Swings in Bond Quality (pp. 22-25)</h3>
<p>Bond quality exhibited secular waves &quot;roughly synchronous in timing with what Burns and Mitchell have identified as turning points of major cycles&quot; (peaks in 1908, 1921, 1933). Quality deteriorated during booms (the 1920s) and improved during busts (the 1930s) — evidence of a &quot;perverse credit cycle&quot; where marginal borrowers accessed the bond market during expansions.</p>
<p>The investment rating agencies, to their credit, &quot;did not lower their standards&quot; during the speculative fervor of the 1920s — the proportion rated in the top four agency grades remained around 80% throughout. The market rating, however, was excessively bouyant in the late twenties.</p>
<h3>Chapter 7: Earnings Coverage and Lien Position (pp. 389-431)</h3>
<p>This is the most relevant chapter for the EPS project.</p>
<h4>Earnings Coverage: Definition and Data (pp. 394-398)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By all odds the most popular measure of earnings coverage is the times-charges-earned ratio, or the number of times that interest charges were earned by the obligor over some specified period preceding the offering.&quot; (p. 394)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The times-charges-earned ratio is published in investment manuals and used to draw up legal lists. Insurance commissioners use it to determine whether securities are legal for life insurance company investment and amortizable after purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Times-charges-earned ratio</strong> = Gross income (all sources, less all expenses and taxes, but BEFORE deduction of fixed charges) / Fixed charges (interest on all debt, net rentals, amortization of debt discount, preferred dividends of subsidiaries)</p>
<p>Both numerator and denominator are averaged over the five years preceding the offering.</p>
<p><strong>Margin of safety</strong> (ratio of net income to gross income) = Net income available for distribution to stockholders (dividends + retained earnings) / Gross income received from sale of products or services, before any deduction for expenses or charges</p>
<p>Both are averaged over five years preceding the offering.</p>
<h4>Earnings Coverage Improved Dramatically (pp. 398-407, Table 81)</h4>
<p>Average times-charges-earned ratio for all industries rose from 1.3 in 1900-1903 to 3.3 in 1940-1943. By industry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Railroads:</strong> Earned charges about 1.5 times on average, reflecting heavy indebtedness</li>
<li><strong>Public utilities:</strong> Just over 2 times on average, with rapid improvement in later years</li>
<li><strong>Industrials:</strong> Approximately 3.5 times, reflecting light indebtedness relative to earnings</li>
</ul>
<p>The improvement reflects both the improving financial health of borrowing corporations and the increasing availability of financial data (the ratio could be computed for only 11% of offerings in 1900-1903 vs. 90% in 1940-1943).</p>
<h4>The Perverse Credit Cycle in Earnings Ratios (pp. 408-412)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking, the average times-charges-earned ratio for bond offerings and the average ratio of net income to gross both reveal a moderate inverse conformity to general business cycles.&quot; (p. 391)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earnings coverage on bond offerings typically DECLINED during early business expansions and ROSE during business contractions. This provides &quot;additional evidence of the existence of a perverse credit cycle in the bond market&quot; — investors accepted lower earnings coverage during booms (when confidence was high) and demanded higher coverage during busts.</p>
<p>Table 83 (Conformity Indexes): Times-charges-earned ratio conformity indexes are -8 for the full cycle (all industries), -26 for industrials. The ratio of net income to gross income similarly shows -8 for the full cycle.</p>
<h4>Default Rates by Earnings Coverage: The Key Tables (pp. 412-420)</h4>

<p><strong>Table 86 — Cross-classification of default rates by BOTH earnings ratios (large issues, all industries):</strong></p>
<p>Default rates fall steadily in BOTH dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCE under 1.0 AND net income/gross under 4%: <strong>50.0%</strong> default</li>
<li>TCE 3.0+ AND net income/gross 20%+: <strong>2.3%</strong> default</li>
<li>Within each TCE class, higher margin of safety → lower default</li>
<li>Within each margin-of-safety class, higher TCE → lower default</li>
</ul>
<p>Chi-square tests confirm both ratios are statistically significant predictors of default, whether used individually or jointly (p &lt; 0.05 in almost all cases; p &lt; 0.01 for most).</p>
<h4>Graham and Dodd's Coverage Standards Validated (p. 415)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It should be noted that in one edition of their text Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd suggest a minimum coverage of one and three-quarter times fixed charges for utilities, two times fixed charges for railroads, and three times fixed charges for industrials.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hickman's data validate these standards: a hypothetical investor setting 1.5 times as the minimum would have excluded 71% of rail defaults and 97% of utility defaults. To achieve similar exclusion rates for industrials would have required approximately 4 times coverage.</p>

<p>The loss rate turns from positive (actual losses) to negative (capital gains) at approximately 1.5 times coverage. For the best-covered bonds (3.0+), investors earned 0.9% MORE than the promised yield.</p>
<p><strong>Key conclusion (p. 430-431):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The large investor who could stand the risks of default and of adverse market fluctuations would not, as a rule, have gained by sacrificing promised yield for an improvement in quality. On the contrary, he would have done best by buying high-yielding reorganization issues with very low earnings coverage. The small investor, however, would have been safer with issues on which fixed charges were earned a substantial number of times (the appropriate coverage depending largely upon the industry).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the combined industries and for total offerings of large issues, the loss rate was zero when fixed charges were earned about one and one-half times. Capital losses occurred below this threshold; capital gains above it.</p>
<h3>The 14 Principal Conclusions (pp. 25-27)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Life-span yields realized equaled yields promised on aggregate — net loss rate was zero.</li>
<li>Capital gains and losses were substantial on bonds offered/extinguished in different periods.</li>
<li>Although the over-all record was excellent, capital losses were large on bonds bought during the buoyant twenties and still outstanding in the thirties.</li>
<li>Agency ratings, market ratings, legal lists, and other quality measures proved useful in ranking bonds by default risk.</li>
<li>High-grade portfolio advantages: low default risk, low loss rate, price stability. Disadvantages: low promised and realized returns.</li>
<li>Low-grade portfolio advantages: high promised yields, and over long periods, high realized yields. Disadvantages: high default and loss rates, price instability.</li>
<li>Small investors fared best with high-grade; large permanent investors frequently did better with diversified low-grade portfolios.</li>
<li>A fixed market-rating standard was less stable than agency ratings or legal lists, but more sensitive to impending defaults over short periods.</li>
<li>Corporate bonds were typically undervalued at default — sellers suffered unnecessarily large losses, buyers obtained unusually large gains.</li>
<li>Because of price instability of low-grade issues, realized returns were usually lower on low grades when purchased at offering and sold at default; conversely, realized returns were higher on low grades when purchased at default and held to extinguishment.</li>
<li>Although life-span loss rates on defaulted bonds were higher for low than for high grades, promised yields at offering were also higher, so realized yields on the various quality groups of defaulted bonds were about the same.</li>
<li>Bond quality was subject to secular and cyclical swings of substantial amplitude, partly because of corporate earnings behavior and partly because of changes in investor confidence.</li>
<li>Errors in rating bonds can be traced principally to the business cycle and to the difficulty of forecasting industry trends.</li>
<li>Typical patterns of behavior emerge only when corporate bonds are viewed in broad aggregates and over long investment periods. Wide disparity was the rule for minor groupings and short periods.</li>
</ol>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Earnings Coverage as the Primary Credit Quality Measure</h3>
<p>Hickman's Chapter 7 demonstrates that the times-charges-earned ratio was &quot;by all odds the most popular measure of earnings coverage&quot; for bond investors throughout 1900-1943. This is earnings-based credit analysis — investors assessed bond safety by examining how many times the firm's earnings covered its fixed charges. This is not a DCF analysis; it is a backward-looking earnings analysis using five-year averages. The entire system of legal lists, insurance company investment standards, and rating agency assessments rested on earnings ratios.</p>
<h3>2. Earnings Predict Default with &quot;Great Regularity&quot;</h3>
<p>The finding that default rates decline monotonically with the times-charges-earned ratio — from 42.9% (under 1.0) to 2.1% (3.0+) — validates the earnings-based approach to credit assessment. Earnings coverage at offering, a backward-looking measure based on five-year averages, predicted default decades into the future with remarkable accuracy. This supports the EPS paradigm's view that backward-looking earnings measures contain forward-looking information.</p>
<h3>3. The Zero Loss Rate and Earnings-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>The finding that net loss rates were approximately zero across the entire universe of corporate bonds — and that the breakeven point was approximately 1.5 times coverage — suggests that bond markets priced risk accurately using earnings-based measures. The market's pricing of bonds through earnings coverage ratios &quot;worked&quot; in the sense that promised yields, set using earnings-based quality assessments, correctly compensated for actual default losses. This is earnings-based pricing in the bond market that parallel's the EPS paradigm's earnings-based pricing in the equity market.</p>
<h3>4. Graham and Dodd's Coverage Standards Validated</h3>
<p>Hickman cites and empirically validates Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's <em>Security Analysis</em> coverage standards (1¾ times for utilities, 2 times for rails, 3 times for industrials). Graham and Dodd are the intellectual founders of the earnings-based approach to security valuation. Hickman's massive empirical study confirms that their rules of thumb — derived from experience and judgment, not from formal theory — performed well as predictors of bond quality.</p>
<h3>5. The Perverse Credit Cycle — Procyclical Risk-Taking</h3>
<p>The finding that earnings coverage on new bond offerings declined during business expansions and rose during contractions parallels the modern observation that corporate leverage increases during booms. In the EPS paradigm, this is explained by falling borrowing rates during expansions: as the spread between the earnings yield and the borrowing rate widens, more firms find leverage EPS-accretive, leading to increased borrowing with lower coverage ratios.</p>
<h3>6. Earnings-Based Quality Assessment Predates and Outlives Theory</h3>
<p>Hickman's study covers 1900-1943 — decades before modern finance theory (CAPM, efficient markets, MM). The entire framework of bond quality assessment was built on earnings ratios, not on formal risk models. This earnings-based framework persisted after the theoretical revolution: credit rating agencies continued to use earnings coverage ratios as primary inputs, and legal lists continued to require minimum coverage standards. The pre-theoretical, practitioner-based approach proved empirically robust.</p>
<h3>7. The Bond Market's Pricing Paradigm Is Yield-Based</h3>
<p>Throughout the study, Hickman describes bond pricing in terms of yields — promised yields, realized yields, yield spreads. The &quot;market rating&quot; is defined as the yield spread between a bond and the best corporate bonds. This is yield-based pricing, not discounted-cash-flow pricing. Bond investors bought a yield (earnings coverage determining the spread over the riskless rate), just as the EPS paradigm describes equity investors buying an earnings yield.</p>

<li><strong>Fisher (1959)</strong> — Lawrence Fisher's &quot;Determinants of Risk Premiums on Corporate Bonds&quot; extends Hickman's analysis, showing that earnings variability and leverage explain most of the cross-section of yield spreads.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (1993)</strong> — The HML factor (value premium) in corporate bonds parallels Hickman's finding that low-grade bonds earned higher returns.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David, Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — Hickman's documentation of earnings-based bond quality assessment and the zero-loss-rate finding support the view that bond markets are priced through earnings-based measures. The perverse credit cycle (lower coverage during expansions) parallels the finding that falling rates made leverage more EPS-accretive, leading to credit deterioration.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Hickman documents that the entire framework for assessing corporate credit quality was earnings-based (times-charges-earned, net income/gross income) for the first half of the twentieth century. This is the bond-market analogue of the EPS paradigm's claim that equity markets use earnings-based pricing. Both bond and equity investors assessed value through earnings, not through discounted cash flows.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — Hickman shows that backward-looking five-year average earnings ratios predicted forward-looking bond default with &quot;great regularity&quot; — supporting the backward-looking asset pricing framework's claim that historical earnings contain forward-looking information.</li>
