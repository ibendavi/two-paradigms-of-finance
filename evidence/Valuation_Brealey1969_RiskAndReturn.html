    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Brealey's 1969 book, written at the London Business School just after the first decade of modern finance theory (CAPM 1964, EMH emerging), devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 7, &quot;Earnings and Stock Prices&quot;) to the empirical relationship between earnings and prices. The key finding: &quot;It is a fundamental tenet of investment practice that stock price changes are to some degree governed by what happens to the company's earnings&quot; (p. 77). Brealey presents extensive evidence that (1) P/E ratios reflect expected earnings growth (explaining 40-69% of cross-sectional P/E variation by industry), (2) earnings surprises move stock prices (+7% for positive surprises, -10% for negative), and (3) an investor who could forecast earnings changes would earn 30.4% annually vs. 12.2% for the market. The chapter documents that even in the newly emerging efficient-markets era, the practical investment world operated on P = f(EPS), not P = PV(future cash flows).</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Opening Statement (p. 77)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is a fundamental tenet of investment practice that stock price changes are to some degree governed by what happens to the company's earnings. There are good reasons for expecting some connection. Just as the value to a company of a piece of equipment depends on the stream of earnings it is expected to produce, so it is reasonable to suppose that the value of the company as a whole will be related to the anticipated stream of earnings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This opening is notable for its careful hedge (&quot;to some degree&quot;) and for framing the price-earnings relationship as arising from &quot;investment practice&quot; rather than from theory. Brealey, writing in the new era of CAPM and EMH, acknowledges that practitioners price stocks based on earnings while being careful not to endorse this as theoretically optimal.</p>
<h3>P/E Ratios and Expected Earnings Growth (pp. 78-80)</h3>
<p>Brealey presents the hypothesis that companies with higher expected earnings growth should trade at higher P/E ratios. He documents three empirical tests:</p>
<p><strong>Test 1: Bank of New York Study (p. 79)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>135 companies analyzed; earnings forecasts made by bank analysts</li>
<li>&quot;differences between companies' expected growth rates explained about 60% of the differences in the ratios of price to normal earnings&quot;</li>
<li>When extended to 170 companies with forecasts from 9 institutions: growth differences &quot;account for 67% of the differences in the ratio of price to normalized earnings&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Test 2: Cross-Industry P/E Variation (Table 19, p. 80)</strong>
Average proportion of P/E differences explained by differences in estimated growth rates, by industry:</p>

</table>
<p>This table shows that within industries, P/E ratios are largely determined by expected earnings growth -- the market uses P/E as its primary valuation tool, not DCF. The variation by industry is informative: in homogeneous industries (Banks, Utilities), growth expectations explain most of the P/E variation; in heterogeneous industries (Steel, Paper), other factors dominate.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Utility Analyst Study (pp. 79-80)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>56 utility companies tracked quarterly, Aug 1964 - Feb 1967</li>
<li>&quot;55% of the differences between the price-earnings ratios of these stocks could be attributed to differences in the forecast rates of growth&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Earnings Surprises and Stock Prices: Brown and Ball (1968) (pp. 82-84)</h3>
<p>Brealey presents the landmark Brown and Ball (1968) study on earnings announcements and stock prices, with two key figures:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 19</strong> (p. 82): Average price movement of stocks with UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks with earnings above forecast appreciate approximately +7% more than what could be attributed to market movements over the 12 months preceding and following the announcement</li>
<li>The adjustment is gradual: only about 10% of the adjustment occurs at the time of the preliminary report publication</li>
<li>&quot;the remainder was spread fairly evenly over the preceding 11 months&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figure 20</strong> (p. 83): Average price movement of stocks with UNEXPECTEDLY BAD earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks with disappointing earnings fall approximately -10% below the level expected from market movements alone</li>
<li>Same gradual adjustment pattern</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The annual appreciation of the stocks of those companies whose earnings were unexpectedly good was more than 7% greater than anything that could be attributed to the effect of changes in the market. Conversely, the stocks of companies with disappointing earnings fell, over the year, almost 10% below the level that might have been expected just from the action of the market.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Earnings Changes Explain Price Changes (Table 20, p. 85)</h3>
<p>Brealey presents Latane and Tuttle's study of 48 randomly selected Value Line stocks, 1950-1963:</p>

</table>
<p>The average of 17.4% is modest but masks huge year-to-year variation (0.3% to 64.5%). In years when other factors (market-wide movements, sentiment shifts) are less dominant, earnings changes explain the majority of individual price variation.</p>
<h3>The Value of Earnings Forecasting (Table 21, pp. 86-87)</h3>
<p>Brealey presents the most striking evidence for the practical importance of earnings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Assume that on March 31, 1962, an investor had been able to distinguish which of these companies would report for the 12 months ending December 1962 earnings increases that were in excess of the average for the period. Suppose, further, that he decided on that day to invest equal sums in all such companies. Twelve months later, his portfolio would have appreciated 4.3% more than Standard and Poor's Industrial Index.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Table 21 shows 12-month performance relative to S&amp;P Industrial Index, by earnings prospects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Above-average earnings prospects:</strong> Consistently positive excess returns, ranging from +4.3% to +35.9%</li>
<li><strong>Below-average earnings prospects:</strong> Consistently negative excess returns, ranging from -2.5% to -12.4%</li>
</ul>
<p>The contrast: &quot;The average annual price appreciation of the 48 stocks was 12.2%. If, however, at the beginning of each year, an investor had been able to select from this group the stocks of those eight companies that were to show the greatest proportionate earnings increase, his average annual profits would have been 30.4%.&quot;</p>
<h3>Beta and Market Sensitivity (Chapter 6, pp. 63-74)</h3>
<p>Chapter 6, &quot;The Effect of the Market Influence on Prices,&quot; introduces what would later be codified as beta. Brealey presents the equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change in Price % = a + b x Market Change %</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using data from 251 NYSE stocks (1927-1960), Brealey demonstrates that this relationship is persistent across sub-periods (correlation of b values between adjacent periods: +0.72 to +0.76). Table 16 (p. 70) shows that stocks sorted into quintiles by prior-period sensitivity retain their rankings in subsequent periods.</p>
<p>This chapter is important as context: Brealey is aware of and presenting the CAPM-related literature (Blume's beta persistence work), but when he turns to explaining what actually determines individual stock prices beyond the market factor, he goes to EARNINGS (Chapter 7), not to risk factors or discount rates.</p>
<h3>Part II Structure: &quot;Earnings&quot;</h3>
<p>The book's structure is revealing. Part I covers &quot;Stock Prices&quot; (market influence, diversification). Part II is titled simply &quot;Earnings&quot; and contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 7: Earnings and Stock Prices</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Earnings as a Random Walk</li>
<li>Chapter 9: The Prediction of Earnings from Financial Data</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that a 1969 book organized around &quot;Risk and Return&quot; devotes fully half its analytical content to EARNINGS (not cash flows, not discount rates) confirms that even in the emerging modern finance era, earnings were understood as the primary driver of stock value.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Transition-Era Evidence</h3>
<p>Brealey (1969) is written at the exact transition point between the old (earnings-based) and new (risk-return) paradigms. The book's structure reveals the tension: its title and Part I gesture toward CAPM and efficient markets, but its substantive content (Parts II and III) is about earnings and dividends. This confirms that even as the academic revolution was underway, the empirical evidence pointed to earnings as the dominant determinant of stock prices.</p>
<h3>2. P = f(EPS) is an Empirical Fact, Not Just Practice</h3>
<p>Brealey is not arguing that investors SHOULD use P/E ratios. He is documenting that the market DOES price stocks based on earnings. The Bank of New York study (60% of P/E variation explained by growth), the Brown and Ball study (earnings surprises move prices), and the Latane/Tuttle study (earnings changes explain price changes) are all empirical findings, not normative recommendations.</p>
<h3>3. The Earnings Yield as Cost of Equity</h3>
<p>While Brealey does not use this terminology, his evidence is consistent with the EPS paradigm's claim that the earnings yield IS the cost of equity. If P/E ratios are set by the market based on comparables and growth expectations, then the earnings yield (E/P) is the market's required return -- observable directly from price and earnings, without needing CAPM or any factor model.</p>
<h3>4. Perfect Earnings Forecast = 30.4% Return</h3>
<p>The Table 21 finding (30.4% vs. 12.2% for the market) demonstrates that earnings are the single most valuable piece of information about a stock. This is not a claim about market efficiency (the information may not be freely available); it is a statement about what determines prices. In the EPS paradigm, this is expected: since P = EPS x P/E, and P/E is relatively stable within industries, forecasting EPS is equivalent to forecasting price.</p>
<h3>5. No DCF, No Cash Flows</h3>
<p>Throughout Chapter 7, Brealey discusses &quot;earnings&quot; -- never &quot;free cash flow,&quot; never &quot;discounted cash flow,&quot; never &quot;present value of future dividends&quot; (except implicitly through the Gordon model framework in passing). The entire practical investment analysis framework is earnings-based. Even in 1969, at MIT Press, from a scholar who would go on to write the dominant modern finance textbook (Brealey, Myers &amp; Allen), the empirical reality was: the market prices stocks on earnings.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Brealey, Myers &amp; Allen, Principles of Corporate Finance</strong> -- Brealey's later textbook (1st ed. 1981) would become the dominant MODERN finance textbook, teaching NPV, CAPM, and MM. The contrast between this 1969 empirical book (earnings drive prices) and the later theoretical textbook (cash flows and discount rates drive prices) captures the paradigm shift perfectly.</li>
<li><strong>Brown and Ball (1968)</strong> -- The earnings announcement study that Brealey presents is one of the founding papers of the event study methodology and post-earnings-announcement drift literature.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934/1940)</strong> -- Brealey's Chapter 7 provides empirical validation for what Graham &amp; Dodd taught qualitatively: earnings and P/E ratios are the primary tools for valuing stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> -- Where Guthmann teaches the CORPORATE FINANCE side (trading on equity, EPS-maximizing leverage), Brealey documents the INVESTOR side (the market prices stocks based on earnings). Together they confirm both halves of the EPS paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Fama (1970)</strong> -- Brealey is writing just before Fama's efficient markets survey. The Brown and Ball results he presents would become central evidence in the EMH literature, but interpreted differently: as evidence of information efficiency, not as evidence that earnings ARE what determines value.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> -- Brealey's Chapter 7 is direct empirical evidence for the investor-side paper. The Bank of New York study, the P/E variation table, and the Brown and Ball results all support P = EPS x P/E as the operative pricing model.</li>
