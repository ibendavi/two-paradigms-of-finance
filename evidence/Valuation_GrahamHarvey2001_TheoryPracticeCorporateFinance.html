    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Graham &amp; Harvey's 2001 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper surveys 392 CFOs on how they actually make capital budgeting, cost of capital, and capital structure decisions. The findings are &quot;both reassuring and puzzling&quot; (p. 232): NPV and CAPM are widely used for project evaluation and cost of equity, but capital structure decisions follow informal criteria — not the academic theories. The single most important finding for the EPS project: <strong>EPS dilution is the #1 factor affecting equity issuance decisions</strong> (mean rating 2.84 on 0-4 scale, with 68.6% rating it important or very important — Table 8, Fig. 7). Brealey and Myers call this concern a &quot;fallacy&quot; (p. 396 of their textbook), yet it dominates actual CFO decision-making. The paper also reveals that financial flexibility and credit ratings — not tax shields or distress costs — are the primary drivers of debt policy. For the EPS project, this is direct survey evidence that managers maximize EPS, not NPV, when making financing decisions.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Survey Design (pp. 187-192)</h3>
<p>The survey was mailed to approximately 4,440 CFOs, yielding 392 responses (8.9% response rate). The sample is drawn from the membership of the Financial Executives Institute (FEI) plus the <em>Fortune</em> 500. Respondents are asked to rate factors on a 0-4 scale (0 = not important, 4 = very important).</p>
<p>The paper covers three domains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capital budgeting methods (Section 3)</li>
<li>Cost of capital estimation (Section 4)</li>
<li>Capital structure decisions (Section 5)</li>
</ol>
<p>Results are cross-tabulated by firm characteristics: size (small/large), P/E (growth/non-growth), leverage (low/high), dividend policy (pays/doesn't pay), investment grade (yes/no), management ownership (low/high), CEO age, CEO tenure, CEO MBA, regulated/unregulated, target debt ratio (yes/no), public/private, foreign sales (yes/no), Fortune 500 (yes/no).</p>
<h3>Capital Budgeting Methods (Section 3, Table 2)</h3>

<p>Key cross-sectional findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large firms are significantly more likely to use NPV</strong> (85.1% vs. 62.8% for small firms)</li>
<li><strong>Small firms use payback almost as much as NPV</strong> (similar frequencies)</li>
<li><strong>P/E multiples are used by 38.9% of all firms</strong> — nearly as common as sensitivity analysis</li>
<li><strong>Highly levered firms are more likely to use earnings multiples</strong> (significant at 5%)</li>
<li>Growth firms (high P/E) are more likely to use NPV than non-growth firms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Payback Period's Persistence:</strong> The payback method, which ignores time value of money and cash flows beyond the payback horizon, is used by 57% of firms. Previous surveys (Gitman and Forrester 1977, Gitman and Mercurio 1982) found it even more popular. Its persistence despite decades of textbook instruction is evidence that managers use simple, intuitive rules rather than formally correct methods.</p>
<h3>Cost of Capital / Cost of Equity (Section 4, Tables 3-5)</h3>
<p><strong>CAPM is dominant, but not universal:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Large firms much more likely to use CAPM (82%) than small firms (65%)</li>
<li>MBA-holding CEOs significantly more likely to use CAPM (77% vs. 67%)</li>
<li><strong>58.8% use the company-wide discount rate</strong> rather than a project-specific rate</li>
<li><strong>Only 15.6% use a divisional rate</strong> matched to the project's risk</li>
<li><strong>Only 9.9% use a different rate for different cash flow components</strong> (e.g., depreciation vs. operating)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is important: 59% of firms use a single company-wide discount rate for ALL projects, even when projects have different risk. This is inconsistent with NPV theory (which requires risk-matched discount rates) but consistent with a simpler &quot;earnings hurdle rate&quot; approach.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors in the discount rate (Table 4):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rate risk (in general level of rates): the MOST commonly considered factor for discount rate</li>
<li><strong>Momentum (recent stock price performance)</strong>: rated moderately important — entirely inconsistent with academic risk models</li>
<li><strong>Market-to-book ratio</strong>: not considered important by most firms</li>
<li>GDP/business cycle risk: moderately important</li>
<li>Foreign exchange risk: moderately important</li>

<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Financial flexibility is #1</strong> — the desire to preserve debt capacity for future needs (2.59 mean)</li>
<li><strong>Credit ratings are #2</strong> — maintaining/improving the credit rating (2.46 mean)</li>
<li><strong>Tax shields are only moderately important</strong> (2.07 mean) — ranked 4th-5th</li>
<li><strong>Bankruptcy/distress costs are NOT important</strong> (1.24 mean) — the lowest-ranked of the major theoretical factors</li>
<li><strong>Comparable firm debt levels matter modestly</strong> (1.49) — some evidence of &quot;industry norms&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Target debt ratios (Fig. 6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>19% have NO target ratio or range</li>
<li>37% have a flexible target</li>
<li>34% have a somewhat tight target/range</li>
<li>10% have a very strict target</li>
<li>Overall: 81% have at least a flexible target, providing moderate support for trade-off theory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pecking order (Section 5.2):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firms value financial flexibility (consistent with pecking order)</li>
<li>BUT desire for flexibility is NOT related to degree of informational asymmetry — inconsistent with pecking-order being driven by information asymmetry</li>
<li>Firms issue debt when internal funds are insufficient (consistent)</li>
<li>Equity undervaluation is important for equity issuance (consistent)</li>
<li>&quot;Asymmetric information variables have no power to predict the relative use of public bonds over equity&quot; (citing Helwege and Liang 1996)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signaling (Section 5.2.3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very few firms indicate debt policy is affected by signaling (0.96 mean rating)</li>
<li>Little evidence firms issue equity to signal prospects (1.31 mean)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agency costs (Section 5.3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very little evidence firms use debt to discipline managers (0.33 mean — second lowest rating in entire survey)</li>
<li>Little evidence debt is used to limit underinvestment</li>
<li>Little evidence short-term debt is used to alleviate asset substitution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Capital Structure: Equity Issuance — THE EPS DILUTION FINDING (Section 5.8.2, Table 8, Fig. 7)</h3>
<p>This is the most important section for the EPS project. Graham &amp; Harvey note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The textbook view is that earnings are not diluted if a firm earns the required return on the new equity. Conversely, if funds are obtained by issuing debt, the number of shares remains constant and so EPS can increase. However, the equity is levered and therefore more risky, so Modigliani and Miller's 'conservation of value' tells us that the stock price will not increase due to higher EPS. Nonetheless, Brealey and Myers (1996) indicate that there is a common belief among executives that share issuance dilutes earnings per share (on p. 396, Brealey and Myers call this view a 'fallacy').&quot; (p. 229)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite academics calling it a &quot;fallacy,&quot; the survey reveals:</p>

<p><strong>EPS dilution is ranked #1 — the single most important factor in equity issuance decisions.</strong> This finding is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More important than equity undervaluation</strong> (the pecking order's key variable)</li>
<li><strong>More important than market timing</strong> (stock price recently risen)</li>
<li><strong>More important than maintaining a target D/E ratio</strong> (trade-off theory's prediction)</li>
<li><strong>More important than financial flexibility, signaling, or any academic theory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-sectional variation in EPS dilution concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large firms: 3.12** vs. small firms: 2.65 (large firms care MORE)</li>
<li>Growth firms: 3.17 vs. non-growth: 3.03</li>
<li><strong>Dividend-paying firms: 3.06 vs. non-dividend: 2.63</strong>* (significant)</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing: 2.60</strong> vs. others: 3.03</li>
<li><strong>CEO has MBA: 2.72</strong>* vs. no MBA: 2.95 — EPS dilution is LESS important when the CEO has an MBA (2.62 vs. 2.95, significant), &quot;perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!&quot; (p. 230)</li>
<li><strong>Regulated firms: 3.60</strong> (extremely high concern) — even though regulation ensures cost recovery</li>
<li><strong>Public firms: 3.18</strong> vs. private: lower (unsurprisingly)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debt Issuance Timing (Section 5.2.6, Table 9)</h3>
<p><strong>CFOs try to time debt markets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We issue debt when interest rates are particularly low&quot; — 46.4% say important/very important (mean 2.22)</li>
<li>Large firms (2.40**) are significantly more likely to time than small firms (2.07)</li>
<li>This is market timing, not optimization — inconsistent with efficient markets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 12: Summary of Theory vs. Evidence</h3>
<p>The paper concludes with a remarkable Table 12 that summarizes how each capital structure theory fares against the survey evidence. The very last entry reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Earnings per share dilution&quot; — ✓ most important factor affecting equity issuance decision.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only entry in Table 12 that receives an unqualified checkmark with no caveats or counter-evidence.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion's Key Admission (p. 232-233)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In our analysis of capital structure, we find that informal criteria such as financial flexibility and credit ratings are the most important debt policy factors. Other informal criteria such as EPS dilution and recent stock price appreciation are the most important factors influencing equity issuance.&quot; (p. 232)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We find moderate support that firms follow the trade-off theory and target their debt ratio. Other results, such as the importance of equity undervaluation and financial flexibility, are generally consistent with the pecking-order view. However, the evidence in favor of these theories does not hold up as well under closer scrutiny.&quot; (pp. 232-233)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the relatively weak support for many capital structure theories indicates that it is time to critically reevaluate the assumptions and implications of these mainline theories. Alternatively, perhaps the theories are valid descriptions of what firms should do — but corporations ignore the theoretical advice.&quot; (p. 233)</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Direct Evidence: EPS Dilution Is #1 for Equity Issuance</h3>
<p>This is the most direct survey evidence that managers maximize EPS. When deciding whether to issue stock, the #1 concern is EPS dilution — not cost of capital, not signaling, not market timing, not information asymmetry. The textbooks call this a &quot;fallacy,&quot; but 68.6% of CFOs rate it important or very important. The EPS paradigm predicts exactly this: managers avoid equity issuance because new shares dilute EPS.</p>
<h3>2. Financial Flexibility = Preserving EPS Capacity</h3>
<p>The #1 debt factor — financial flexibility — is easily interpreted through the EPS lens: managers want to preserve borrowing capacity for future EPS-accretive investments. If the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate, unused debt capacity represents future EPS growth potential.</p>
<h3>3. Credit Ratings = EPS Protection</h3>
<p>The #2 debt factor — credit ratings — matters because a downgrade raises borrowing costs, which reduces the EY-borrowing rate spread, making leverage less EPS-accretive. Managers protect credit ratings to maintain the cheapness of debt relative to equity (as measured by the earnings yield).</p>
<h3>4. Tax Shields Are Only Moderate — Not the Primary Driver</h3>
<p>The trade-off theory's centerpiece (tax deductibility of interest) is only moderately important (2.07 mean). This is inconsistent with the standard academic model but consistent with the EPS paradigm, where tax shields are embedded in the after-tax borrowing cost (which affects the EY-cost spread) rather than being a separate consideration.</p>
<h3>5. Distress Costs Are Irrelevant</h3>
<p>The other half of the trade-off theory — bankruptcy/distress costs — gets the lowest rating (1.24) among major factors. Managers don't think about the trade-off between tax shields and distress costs. They think about flexibility, credit ratings, and EPS dilution.</p>
<h3>6. Payback and P/E Multiples Are Widely Used</h3>
<p>38.9% of firms use P/E multiples for capital budgeting — direct evidence that earnings-based valuation is used for real investment decisions. Payback (56.7%) is also earnings-adjacent: it measures how quickly a project &quot;pays for itself&quot; in earnings, ignoring the discount rate entirely.</p>
<h3>7. The Company-Wide Discount Rate = The Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>59% of firms use a single company-wide rate rather than project-specific rates. This is inconsistent with NPV theory (which requires risk-adjusted rates) but consistent with using the firm's earnings yield as the hurdle rate — a single number that applies to all projects.</p>
<h3>8. The MBA Effect on EPS Concern</h3>
<p>The finding that CEOs with MBAs care LESS about EPS dilution (2.62 vs. 2.95 without MBA) suggests that business school education partially overrides EPS-maximizing instincts. Graham &amp; Harvey speculate &quot;perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!&quot; This is direct evidence of the academic paradigm competing with — but not dominating — the practitioner paradigm.</p>
<h3>9. &quot;Reassuring and Puzzling&quot; = Two Paradigms Coexisting</h3>
<p>Graham &amp; Harvey's conclusion — that practice is &quot;both reassuring and puzzling&quot; — reflects the two-paradigm world the EPS project documents. Capital budgeting is &quot;reassuring&quot; (NPV/CAPM used) because the academic paradigm has penetrated project evaluation. Capital structure is &quot;puzzling&quot; because the old paradigm (EPS-based decision-making) still dominates financing decisions.</p>
<h3>10. Table 12's Last Entry Is the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>The summary table's final entry — &quot;Earnings per share dilution: ✓ most important factor affecting equity issuance decision&quot; — is the EPS paradigm reduced to a single line. It is the only entry that receives an unqualified confirmation with no counter-evidence.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — Myers showed that capital structure theories have &quot;an unacceptably low R².&quot; Graham &amp; Harvey provide the survey evidence 17 years later: managers don't follow the theories Myers evaluated.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — Graham &amp; Harvey confirm Lintner's findings on dividend smoothing: managers avoid cutting dividends and target payout ratios. The dividend behavior Lintner documented in 1956 persists in 2001.</li>
<li><strong>Donaldson (1961)</strong> — Donaldson found that managers refused to issue equity even when P/E ratios were high. Graham &amp; Harvey confirm: EPS dilution concern overrides market timing considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958, 1963)</strong> — MM's irrelevance theorems predict that EPS dilution from equity issuance shouldn't matter (Brealey &amp; Myers call it a &quot;fallacy&quot;). The survey flatly contradicts this: EPS dilution is the #1 equity issuance factor.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon &amp; Shapiro (1956)</strong> — Gordon &amp; Shapiro showed that the earnings yield is commonly used as the required rate of profit. Graham &amp; Harvey's finding that 59% use a company-wide discount rate is consistent: firms use a single rate (plausibly the earnings yield) rather than risk-adjusting.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean documented the payback method's popularity. Graham &amp; Harvey confirm it persists (57%) despite decades of academic criticism.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon tried to shift managers from EPS maximization to wealth maximization. Graham &amp; Harvey show that for equity issuance, this shift has not occurred: EPS dilution still dominates.</li>
<li><strong>Brealey &amp; Myers (1996)</strong> — The textbook calls EPS dilution a &quot;fallacy&quot; (p. 396). Graham &amp; Harvey show this &quot;fallacy&quot; is the #1 concern for CFOs. The MBA effect (lower concern among MBA-holders) suggests the textbook partially works — but the old paradigm persists.</li>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — Agency theory predicts debt disciplines managers. Graham &amp; Harvey find almost no evidence (0.33 rating) that managers use debt for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Graham &amp; Harvey (2001) is perhaps the single most important paper for the EPS project's empirical support. It directly surveys CFOs and finds that EPS dilution is the #1 factor in equity issuance — exactly the EPS paradigm's prediction. Every finding in the paper maps onto the EPS paradigm's framework.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — The survey demonstrates the two-paradigm world: NPV/CAPM have penetrated capital budgeting (the academic paradigm's success story), but capital structure decisions remain governed by EPS considerations (the old paradigm's persistence). The MBA effect shows the boundary between the two worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — The 38.9% of firms using P/E multiples for project evaluation, plus 57% using payback, provide direct evidence that earnings-based capital budgeting coexists with NPV.</li>
