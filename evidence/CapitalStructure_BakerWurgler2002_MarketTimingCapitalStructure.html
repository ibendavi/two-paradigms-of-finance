    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Baker &amp; Wurgler's 2002 <em>Journal of Finance</em> paper proposes that capital structure is the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. Using Compustat firms that conducted IPOs between 1968 and 1999, they document that firms issue equity when market valuations are high (high market-to-book) and repurchase or use debt when valuations are low. The key innovation is the &quot;external finance weighted-average&quot; market-to-book ratio (M/B_efwa) — a weighted average of past M/B ratios where the weights are the amounts of external finance raised each year. This historical valuation measure is the single strongest determinant of current capital structure, dominating all standard variables (current M/B, profitability, asset tangibility, firm size). Most strikingly, the effect persists for at least a decade: market-to-book fluctuations from 10+ years ago still significantly affect current leverage, with at least two-thirds of the initial effect remaining after 10 years (Table VI). Baker &amp; Wurgler conclude that &quot;there is no optimal capital structure, so market timing financing decisions just accumulate over time into the capital structure outcome.&quot; For the EPS project, this paper documents the empirical pattern that the EPS paradigm explains more simply: firms issue equity when it is &quot;cheap&quot; (low earnings yield = high M/B) and repurchase when equity is &quot;expensive&quot; (high earnings yield = low M/B) — not because they are timing mispricings, but because the earnings yield determines the cost of equity relative to the cost of debt.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Central Hypothesis (pp. 1-4)</h3>
<p>Baker &amp; Wurgler propose a theory of capital structure based on market timing: firms issue equity when they perceive it as overvalued (high M/B) and repurchase equity or issue debt when they perceive it as undervalued (low M/B). If these timing attempts have persistent effects — if firms do not subsequently rebalance to some optimal leverage — then capital structure at any point in time is simply the cumulative result of all past market-timing decisions.</p>
<p>This contrasts with three existing theories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trade-off theory:</strong> Firms have an optimal leverage ratio determined by the balance of tax shields vs. bankruptcy costs. Past financing decisions should not matter if firms rebalance.</li>
<li><strong>Pecking order theory (Myers &amp; Majluf 1984):</strong> Firms prefer internal funds, then debt, then equity, due to information asymmetry. No optimal target, but financing depends on current investment needs and cash flows, not market valuations.</li>
<li><strong>Managerial entrenchment (Zwiebel 1996):</strong> Managers become entrenched during high-valuation periods when equity is easy to issue, then refuse to rebalance later.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The M/B_efwa Variable (pp. 7-8)</h3>
<p>The key innovation is the <strong>external finance weighted-average market-to-book ratio</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M/B_{efwa,t-1} = Σ_{s=0}^{t-1} [(e_s + d_s) / Σ_{r=0}^{t-1} (e_r + d_r)] × (M/B)_s    (Equation 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where e_s and d_s are net equity and net debt issued in year s, and (M/B)_s is the market-to-book ratio in year s. Negative total financing weights are set to zero.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> M/B_efwa is high when the firm raised most of its external finance during periods of high market valuations, and low when most finance was raised during periods of low valuations. It captures the historical path of market timing.</p>
<h3>Data and Sample (pp. 5-7)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> All Compustat firms that conducted an IPO between 1968 and 1999 (identified by the first appearance of market value data). Leverage defined as book debt to total assets (book leverage) or book debt to the result of total assets minus book equity plus market equity (market leverage). Outliers with M/B &gt; 10 excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Control variables:</strong> Current M/B (M/B_{t-1}), fixed asset intensity (PPE/A_{t-1}), profitability (EBITDA/A_{t-1}), firm size (log(S)_{t-1}).</p>

<p>Key observation: Leverage drops sharply at IPO (from 66.5% to 43.2% book), then very gradually rises. The IPO itself — an equity issue timed to market conditions — permanently transforms the capital structure.</p>
<h3>Table II: Determinants of Changes in Leverage (pp. 11-13)</h3>
<p>Annual panel regressions decomposing leverage changes into components:</p>
<p><strong>(D/A)<em>t - (D/A)</em>{t-1} = a + b(M/B)_{t-1} + controls + u_t</strong></p>
<p>For book leverage, the M/B coefficient is -1.95 (t = -11.48). The decomposition reveals the mechanism:</p>

<p>High M/B reduces leverage PRIMARILY through net equity issues (-1.20), not through retained earnings. Firms actively issue equity when valuations are high. The growth channel (-0.80) reflects mechanical dilution as assets grow.</p>

<p><strong>(IPO + 1, All Firms sample)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The crucial result:</strong> M/B_efwa has a coefficient of -4.93 (t = -5.63) for book leverage — by far the largest and most significant determinant. A one-standard-deviation increase in M/B_efwa reduces book leverage by ~5 percentage points. The CURRENT M/B ratio is essentially zero (0.07, t = 0.10) once M/B_efwa is included.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> What matters for leverage is not where the firm's valuation is TODAY, but where it was WHEN THE FIRM RAISED CAPITAL. Historical market valuations, not current ones, drive capital structure.</p>
<h3>Table IV: Robust to Fama-French (2000) Controls (pp. 17-18)</h3>
<p>Adding Fama &amp; French (2000) control variables (lagged leverage, two-year asset growth, expected profitability) does not diminish the M/B_efwa effect. The coefficient remains -5.90 (t = -4.51) for book leverage.</p>
<h3>Table V: Cumulative Changes from Pre-IPO (pp. 21-22)</h3>
<p>Equation (6) regresses the CUMULATIVE change in leverage since pre-IPO on M/B_efwa and controls. Results confirm that M/B_efwa explains the permanent transformation in capital structure that occurs at and after the IPO. For the &quot;All Firms&quot; sample (1980-1999), M/B_efwa coefficient is -6.81 (t = -16.72) for book leverage changes.</p>
<h3>Table VI: Persistence of Market-to-Book Effects (pp. 23-24)</h3>
<p>The persistence test uses three simultaneous regressions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leverage at t+1 on M/B_efwa at t (coefficient b₁)</li>
<li>Leverage at t+τ on M/B_efwa at t (coefficient b₂)</li>
<li>Leverage at t+τ on M/B_efwa at t with FUTURE controls at t+τ-1 (coefficient b₃)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After 10 years, 73% of the initial M/B_efwa effect remains</strong> (b₂/b₁ = 0.73). The lower bound (95% confidence) is 0.66 for book leverage and 0.88 for market leverage. Baker &amp; Wurgler conclude: &quot;For market leverage, the effect is 100 percent permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Even more striking: b₃ (controlling for FUTURE characteristics) is &quot;several times the size of the c₃ coefficients&quot; (current M/B effect), meaning &quot;the historical path of market-to-book, even calculated with data over 10 years old, is much more influential than the current market-to-book.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section II: Discussion — Competing Theories (pp. 25-28)</h3>
<p><strong>A. Trade-off Theory (p. 25):</strong> The trade-off theory predicts that capital structure should revert to the optimum, meaning past financing events should not have lasting effects. The 10+ year persistence of M/B_efwa effects is &quot;hard to understand&quot; within trade-off theory. One could argue adjustment costs are so large that deviating for 10 years is not worthwhile, &quot;but our results make the point that a considerable fraction of cross-sectional variation in leverage has nothing to do with an optimum set by current characteristics.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B. Pecking Order Theory (pp. 26-27):</strong> The static pecking order (Myers 1984, Myers &amp; Majluf 1984) predicts that firms use internal funds first, then debt, then equity. High M/B periods should increase debt capacity, pushing leverage UP. Baker &amp; Wurgler find the opposite: high M/B reduces leverage through equity issuance. &quot;Our results are also somewhat difficult to reconcile with this interpretation.&quot; The dynamic version (reduce leverage during high-growth periods to preserve future borrowing capacity) also fails: &quot;leverage is much more strongly determined by PAST values of market-to-book.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>C. Managerial Entrenchment (p. 27):</strong> Zwiebel (1996) predicts managers issue equity when valuations are high and become entrenched, refusing to rebalance. This &quot;has a market-timing flavor&quot; but with a different interpretation: &quot;Managers are not attempting to exploit new investors... they are exploiting existing investors ex post by not rebalancing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>D. Market Timing Theory (pp. 27-28):</strong> Baker &amp; Wurgler's preferred explanation. Two versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Myers-Majluf:</strong> Adverse selection costs vary over time. When M/B is high, the adverse selection discount is small relative to the equity overshoot, so firms issue equity. Rational version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mispricing/perception-based:</strong> Managers issue equity when they believe its cost is irrationally low (high M/B = overvalued). Survey evidence: Graham &amp; Harvey (2001) report that CFOs admit trying to time the market, and two-thirds &quot;considered the amount by which our stock is undervalued or overvalued&quot; when deciding to issue equity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence favoring the mispricing version: &quot;the low long-run stock returns following equity issues and the high long-run returns following repurchases&quot; suggest managers are, on average, SUCCESSFUL at timing. &quot;The total gains to market timing [are] even bigger in comparison to the adverse announcement effect, and suggests that outright mispricing is the primary motivation.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section III: Conclusion (p. 29)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We believe the most realistic explanation for the results is that capital structure is largely the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. In this theory, there is no optimal capital structure, so market timing financing decisions just accumulate over time into the capital structure outcome. This simple market timing theory of capital structure appears to have substantial explanatory power.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Appendix Table AI: Robustness Tests (pp. 29-30)</h3>
<p>Six robustness tests confirm the M/B_efwa result:</p>
<ol>
<li>SIC-3 fixed effects</li>
<li>IPO-year fixed effects</li>
<li>Retained earnings control (confirming effect comes through equity issues, not retained earnings)</li>
<li>Start M/B = End M/B (firms whose endpoint M/B matches IPO M/B — the PATH matters, not endpoints)</li>
<li>Outliers included</li>
<li>Tobit estimation (for censored leverage variable)</li>
</ol>
<p>All robustness tests preserve the strong negative M/B_efwa coefficient (range: -5.77 to -21.82 across specifications).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Earnings Yield as Cost of Equity — Not &quot;Market Timing&quot;</h3>
<p>Baker &amp; Wurgler document that firms issue equity when M/B is high (earnings yield is low) and use debt/repurchase when M/B is low (earnings yield is high). They interpret this as &quot;market timing&quot; — exploiting mispricing. The EPS paradigm offers a simpler interpretation: the earnings yield IS the cost of equity. When M/B is high (earnings yield is low), equity is genuinely cheap relative to debt, so rational EPS-maximizing managers issue equity. When M/B is low (earnings yield is high), equity is genuinely expensive, so managers repurchase and use debt. No mispricing needed.</p>
<h3>2. M/B Is the Inverse of the Earnings Yield (Approximately)</h3>
<p>For firms with stable ROE, M/B ≈ (P/E) × ROE. High M/B firms are approximately low earnings yield firms. Baker &amp; Wurgler's finding that high M/B leads to equity issuance is equivalent to saying low earnings yield leads to equity issuance — which is the EPS paradigm's prediction: when the earnings yield is below the cost of debt, equity is cheap, so firms issue it.</p>
<h3>3. The &quot;No Optimal Capital Structure&quot; Conclusion Aligns with EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Baker &amp; Wurgler conclude &quot;there is no optimal capital structure&quot; — capital structure is just the cumulative result of past financing decisions. The EPS paradigm agrees: there is no optimal leverage ratio in the trade-off theory sense. Capital structure is determined by the ongoing comparison of the earnings yield to the borrowing rate. When EY &gt; borrowing rate, firms lever up and repurchase (boosting EPS). When EY &lt; borrowing rate (rare, mostly growth firms), firms may issue equity. The resulting leverage is a function of the history of earnings yields and interest rates, not an optimal target.</p>
<h3>4. Persistence Without Rebalancing — EPS Maximizers Don't Rebalance Either</h3>
<p>The 10-year persistence of M/B_efwa effects puzzles trade-off theory (why don't firms revert to the optimum?). The EPS paradigm explains this naturally: there is nothing to revert to. EPS-maximizing managers only change capital structure when the earnings yield vs. borrowing rate comparison changes. If a firm issued equity when its earnings yield was low (high M/B) and the earnings yield has remained low, there is no EPS-based reason to lever up. The &quot;persistence&quot; is simply stable earnings yields producing stable financing policies.</p>
<h3>5. Graham &amp; Harvey Survey Evidence Supports Both Interpretations</h3>
<p>Baker &amp; Wurgler cite Graham &amp; Harvey (2001) as evidence that managers time the market. But Graham &amp; Harvey also find that managers cite &quot;EPS dilution&quot; as the #1 concern in equity issuance decisions (67.6% say it's important). The same survey evidence that Baker &amp; Wurgler use to support market timing also supports EPS maximization — managers avoid equity issuance because it dilutes EPS, and they issue equity when the dilution cost is low (high M/B = low earnings yield).</p>
<h3>6. The Equity Issuance Channel Confirms EPS Mechanism</h3>
<p>Table II shows that high M/B reduces leverage PRIMARILY through net equity issues (coefficient -1.20), NOT through retained earnings (coefficient 0.05). This confirms that the mechanism is active equity issuance decisions, not passive accumulation. EPS-maximizing managers actively choose to issue equity when the earnings yield makes it cheap — consistent with the EPS paradigm's prediction.</p>
<h3>7. Why Historical Path Matters — The EPS History</h3>
<p>The finding that M/B_efwa (historical valuation path) dominates current M/B in explaining leverage has a natural EPS interpretation. A firm that raised capital during high-M/B periods locked in low-cost equity (low earnings yield at issuance). This capital stays on the balance sheet regardless of current conditions. The &quot;history&quot; is simply the accumulated result of past EPS-optimal financing decisions — each made when the earnings yield comparison favored equity.</p>
