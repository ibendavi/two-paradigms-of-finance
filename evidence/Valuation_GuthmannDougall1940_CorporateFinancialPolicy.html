    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>This major pre-MM corporate finance textbook (Northwestern University, Prentice-Hall) explicitly teaches: (1) &quot;trading on equity&quot; as the mechanism by which leverage magnifies earnings per share, (2) earnings capitalization as the standard method for valuing businesses in mergers, and (3) merger exchange ratios determined by earnings per share contributed. Written 18 years before Modigliani-Miller, it demonstrates that EPS maximization through leverage was the established framework taught in universities.</p>

      <h2>Trading on Equity (pp. 115-118)</h2>
<h3>The Logic of EPS-Maximizing Leverage</h3>
<p>The textbook devotes a major section to &quot;Trading on Equity&quot; — the use of borrowed funds to increase returns to common stockholders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The customary reason for trading on equity is the hope of employing these 'senior' funds at a rate of return higher than their cost in order to increase the return upon the investment of the residual owners.&quot; (p. 115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the EPS maximization logic: borrow at a fixed rate (bond interest) lower than the earnings yield, and the difference accrues to common stockholders.</p>

<h3>Key Teaching Points</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;It increases the degree of fluctuation in the rate of return upon common stockholders' investment.&quot;</strong> — Leverage amplifies both upside and downside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Success... depends upon the excess of the rate earned on investment over the rate paid for the borrowed money.&quot;</strong> — The EPS-accretive condition: earnings yield &gt; borrowing rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Because trading on equity magnifies the influence of fluctuations like a lever, the expression 'capital structure with high leverage' is applied where a large proportion of senior securities come ahead of the common stock.&quot;</strong> (p. 117)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Critical Quote on Management Objective (p. 115)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;corporate policy is supposed to be guided in the interest of maximizing the profits of its owners and not of any corporate abstraction, the judicious use of debt for the purpose of making as good an investment record as possible for the common stock will enable the corporation to finance with a minimum of difficulty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explicitly states that management's objective is to maximize returns to common stockholders — and that leverage is the tool to achieve this. This is the EPS maximization objective function, stated 18 years before MM.</p>
<h2>Earnings Capitalization in Mergers (pp. 585-599)</h2>
<h3>The Standard Valuation Formula</h3>
<p>When determining merger exchange ratios, Guthmann &amp; Dougall present earnings capitalization as the primary method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If 10 per cent earnings are necessary to attract common stock investors in this type and size of business... then the value of the common stock equities is the value of a $770,000 income capitalized at 10 per cent, or $7,700,000.&quot; (p. 588)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Formula used:</strong> V = E / r, where E = earnings available to common, r = required earnings yield.</p>
<h3>Earnings Per Share as the Exchange Basis (p. 591)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This basis is equivalent to exchanging the shares in proportion to the earnings per share of the former companies, which had been $30 and $16 per share, respectively.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The merger exchange ratio is explicitly determined by the ratio of EPS between the two companies. This is precisely the EPS-based pricing that the EPS project documents.</p>
<h3>Capitalization Rate Table (p. 595)</h3>
<p>The textbook presents this explicit table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Earnings</th>
<th>Capitalization Rate</th>
<th>Market Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$1.00</td>
<td>4%</td>
<td>$25.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1.00</td>
<td>6%</td>
<td>$16.67</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1.00</td>
<td>8%</td>
<td>$12.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1.00</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>$10.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This IS the P = E/r formula, presented as standard practitioner knowledge. No present value of future cash flows — just current earnings divided by a market-determined yield.</p>
<h3>Leverage Creates Value Through Earnings Capitalization (pp. 594-595)</h3>
<p>A remarkable passage shows how capital structure can increase total market value through differential capitalization rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: $12M earnings, all-equity → $150M value (capitalized at 8%)
Same $12M earnings, with $80M preferred at 5% → $4M preferred dividends, $8M for common → common capitalized at 8% = $100M, plus $80M preferred = $180M total</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a matter of principle, it might be argued that the risk for the common is increased by the introduction of preferred, and therefore the rate of capitalization for the common stock earnings would rise so as to counterbalance the advantage. In practice, the market often fails to show such a nicety of risk appraisal...&quot; (p. 595)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This passage directly anticipates and contradicts Modigliani-Miller (1958).</strong> MM's Proposition I states that total firm value is independent of capital structure. Guthmann &amp; Dougall explicitly show that practitioners believed capital structure could increase total value — and note that the theoretical counterargument (risk adjustment) was not observed in practice. This is the pre-MM world, documented in a leading textbook.</p>
<h3>Nash-Kelvinator Merger (1936) — Real-World Example (pp. 597-598)</h3>
<p>Detailed worked example using actual data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nash:</strong> EPS = $0.39 (latest year), $0.51 (5-yr avg), market price $16.50</li>
<li><strong>Kelvinator:</strong> EPS = $1.34 (latest year), $0.82 (5-yr avg), market price $21.50</li>
<li>Exchange ratio: 1.5 Nash-Kelvinator shares per Kelvinator share</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis explicitly compares earnings per share, book value per share, net current assets per share, and market price per share. EPS is the primary metric for evaluating the merger terms.</p>
<h2>Determinants of Capital Structure (Chapter 9, pp. 189-210)</h2>
<p>Chapter 9, &quot;Determining Form of Capital Structure,&quot; is a systematic treatment of what determines how a firm is financed. The determinants are all EARNINGS-BASED -- no mention of tax shields, agency costs, or information asymmetry:</p>
<h3>External Influences</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Attitudes of the investment market&quot; and &quot;General level of interest rates&quot; (p. 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the management will seek to take advantage of the condition, if possible, by long-term or permanent financing&quot; (p. 191) -- when rates are low, firms borrow more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the interest-rate-driven leverage decision that the EPS paradigm predicts: when borrowing rates fall below the earnings yield, debt becomes EPS-accretive, and managers lever up.</p>
<h3>By Industry Type</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Public utilities:</strong> &quot;bonds are likely to be issued up to the limits which the standards of the investment market will permit&quot; because of &quot;assurance of earning power upon a relatively stable level&quot; (p. 206). Utilities maximize leverage because their stable earnings make debt safe and EPS-accretive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> &quot;The simple capital structure is looked upon as the 'ideal' form for the manufacturing corporation&quot; (p. 199). Variable earnings make heavy debt dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial companies:</strong> &quot;capital structures are uniformly of one class of security -- namely, common stock&quot; (p. 208). The nature of financial company assets (other companies' securities) makes them unsuitable as bond collateral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter Summary (p. 209)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This chapter has surveyed the several financial characteristics which primarily influence the manner of raising funds and the form of capital structure of the several classes of business.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key determinants listed are: (a) amount of assets needed, (b) uncertainty of earnings, (c) rate at which sufficient earning power is generated. All three are earnings-related. There is NO mention of taxes, agency costs, or asymmetric information as drivers of capital structure.</p>
<h3>The Cost of Equity is the Earnings Yield (p. 114)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A manufacturing corporation that might borrow on bonds for 5 per cent might have to hold out the hope of earnings of 8 or 10 per cent upon its common stock in order to find buyers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage explicitly identifies the earnings yield (8-10%) as the cost of equity capital -- observable from what investors demand, not derived from a theoretical model. The spread between the borrowing rate (5%) and the earnings yield (8-10%) is the gain from trading on equity.</p>
<h2>Dividend Policy (Chapter 22, pp. 532-544)</h2>
<p>The first factor determining dividends: &quot;The amount of earnings available&quot; (p. 535). Followed by stability of earnings, cash position, source of surplus, and reserve policy. The discussion is entirely in terms of earnings available for distribution — no mention of free cash flow or NPV of future dividends.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p><strong>This textbook is a primary source confirming that the pre-MM world of corporate finance operated on earnings capitalization:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Trading on Equity&quot; IS EPS maximization.</strong> The textbook explicitly teaches managers to use leverage to increase returns per share of common stock. The decision rule is: borrow when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate. This is the core of the EPS paradigm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The management objective is stated as maximizing returns to common stockholders</strong> (p. 115) — not maximizing firm value or NPV. Corporate policy is &quot;guided in the interest of maximizing the profits of its owners.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mergers are valued by capitalizing earnings</strong> (V = E/r), and exchange ratios are set by EPS contributions. No DCF, no projected future cash flows, no risk-adjusted discount rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The textbook anticipates MM Proposition I — and rejects it in practice</strong> (pp. 594-595). It acknowledges the theoretical argument that risk adjustment should offset leverage benefits, but notes that &quot;the market often fails to show such a nicety of risk appraisal.&quot; This is exactly what MM would formalize 18 years later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Earnings yields (capitalization rates) are market-determined comparables</strong> — 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% depending on the type of security and business. These are observed from the market, not derived from a theoretical model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>832 pages, Prentice-Hall, Northwestern University</strong> — this was a major textbook, not a fringe publication. Its methods represent mainstream corporate finance teaching in the pre-MM era.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Badger (1925)</strong> — Same framework 15 years earlier. Badger's 18.8% earnings yield for common stocks vs. Guthmann's 8-10% range reflects different market conditions (1920s vs. late 1930s).</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</strong> — Similar earnings capitalization approach, but G&amp;D focus more on security analysis while G&amp;D focus on corporate financial policy (the management side).</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's &quot;The Theory of Financial Management&quot; would later try to bridge this earnings-based framework with the emerging DCF/NPV framework.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani-Miller (1958)</strong> — MM's Proposition I directly contradicts the claim on pp. 594-595 that capital structure can increase total value. The fact that a leading 1940 textbook teaches this &quot;incorrectly&quot; (by MM standards) confirms that practitioners operated in a fundamentally different paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — This textbook is direct evidence for the paper's claim that pre-MM corporate finance was organized around EPS maximization through &quot;trading on equity.&quot;</li>
