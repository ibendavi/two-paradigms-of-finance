    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Myers's 1984 <em>Journal of Finance</em> presidential address contrasts two theories of capital structure — the static trade-off theory and the pecking order theory — and argues the pecking order does at least as well empirically. The paper is organized as a &quot;one-on-one competition&quot; between the theories. The static trade-off posits that firms target an optimal debt ratio that balances tax benefits of debt against costs of financial distress, then gradually adjust toward it. The pecking order, formalized here through the Myers-Majluf (1984) asymmetric information model, posits that firms prefer internal finance, then debt, then equity — resulting in no well-defined target leverage ratio. Myers presents five empirical &quot;facts&quot; about financing behavior: (1) internal finance dominates (62% of capex for non-financial firms 1973-82); (2) firms with tangible assets and growth opportunities borrow less; (3) firms time equity issues to high stock prices; (4) exchange offers produce asymmetric price reactions (debt-for-equity positive, equity-for-debt negative); (5) stock issues cause price declines, repurchases cause increases. His &quot;modified pecking order&quot; proposes that observed debt ratios reflect cumulative historical requirements for external finance, not optimization toward a target. This is the most-cited paper in capital structure and the one that established the trade-off vs. pecking order framework that has dominated the field for four decades. For the EPS project, this paper is essential because it frames the entire debate that the EPS paradigm dissolves.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Introduction: The Puzzle (pp. 1-2 of working paper)</h3>
<p>Myers opens by echoing Fischer Black's famous dividend puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper's title is intended to remind you of Fischer Black's well-known note on 'The Dividend Puzzle,' which he closed by saying, 'What should the corporation do about dividend policy? We don't know.' I will start by asking, 'How do firms choose their capital structures?' Again, the answer is, 'We don't know.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notes that Lintner's (1956) dividend model still works, and dividends clearly have information content — but for capital structure, &quot;we know very little.&quot; There has been little research testing whether leverage and returns are related as MM theory predicts.</p>
<h3>Three Hypotheses (pp. 2-4)</h3>
<p>Myers identifies three possible explanations for capital structure:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static trade-off theory:</strong> Firms target an optimal debt ratio balancing tax shields against distress costs</li>
<li><strong>Pecking order theory:</strong> Firms prefer internal to external finance, and debt to equity if external finance is needed</li>
<li><strong>Neutral mutations (Miller 1977):</strong> Some financing habits may have no material effect on firm value</li>
</ol>
<p>Myers explicitly excludes &quot;managerial&quot; theories (footnote 1): he chooses NOT to consider models that &quot;cut the umbilical cord that ties managers' acts to stockholders' interests.&quot; He also sets aside Miller's neutral mutations, though he acknowledges it as a useful null hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper is designed as a one-on-one competition of the static tradeoff and pecking-order stories.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Static Trade-Off Hypothesis (pp. 4-9)</h3>
<p><strong>The classic framework (Figure 1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firm value increases with debt due to interest tax shields</li>
<li>Firm value decreases beyond some point due to costs of financial distress</li>
<li>The optimum is where marginal benefit of debt = marginal cost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems with static trade-off:</strong></p>
<p><em>Costs of adjustment:</em> If adjustment costs are small, firms should be near their optima — but then cross-sectional variation in debt ratios among similar firms is hard to explain. If adjustment costs are large, firms can be far from optima — but then we should study the adjustment costs, not the static optimum.</p>
<p><em>Debt and taxes:</em> Miller's (1977) &quot;Debt and Taxes&quot; cut us loose from the extreme MM implication that all firms should be 100% debt. Miller described an equilibrium where personal taxes on interest offset corporate tax shields at the margin. But this requires all firms to face the same marginal tax rate — which is false (firms with loss carryforwards face very different effective rates). Figure 2 plots the net tax gain from borrowing against the effective tax rate, showing that the MM theory, Miller theory, and compromise theories all predict the same cross-sectional differences: high-tax firms should borrow more.</p>
<p><em>Costs of financial distress:</em> Risky firms should borrow less (higher default probability). Firms with tangible assets can borrow more (lower loss in distress). Specialized, intangible assets and growth opportunities lose more value in distress.</p>
<h3>The Pecking Order Theory (pp. 9-16)</h3>
<p><strong>The four rules of the pecking order:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Firms prefer internal finance</li>
<li>They adapt target dividend payout ratios to their investment opportunities (though dividends are sticky and only gradually adjusted)</li>
<li>Sticky dividends + unpredictable fluctuations mean internal cash may exceed or fall short of investment needs</li>
<li>If external finance is needed, firms issue the safest security first: safe debt, then risky debt, then hybrid securities (convertibles), then equity as last resort</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>No well-defined target debt-equity mix:</strong> Internal equity (retained earnings) is at the top of the pecking order, external equity at the bottom. The observed debt ratio reflects the firm's cumulative requirement for external finance.</p>
<p><strong>The pecking order literature:</strong>
Myers cites Donaldson (1961) as the key early empirical source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Management strongly favored internal generation as a source of new funds even to the exclusion of external funds except for occasional unavoidable 'bulges' in the need for funds.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Critical quote from Donaldson about equity issuance:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Though few companies would go so far as to rule out a sale in any circumstances, the large majority had not had such a sale in the past 20 years and did not anticipate one in the foreseeable future. This was particularly remarkable in view of the very high Price-Earnings ratios of recent years. Several financial officers showed that they were well aware that this had been a good time to sell common, but the reluctance still persisted.&quot; (p. 57-58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extraordinary: managers refused to issue equity even when P/E ratios were very high — exactly the opposite of what the EPS paradigm would predict (high P/E = low earnings yield = cheap equity).</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetric information foundation (Myers &amp; Majluf 1984):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firm needs N dollars for a positive-NPV project</li>
<li>Manager knows true value x and project NPV y; investors see only distributions (x̃, ỹ)</li>
<li>Manager maximizes the intrinsic value of existing shares</li>
<li>If the firm is undervalued (ΔN &gt; 0), the manager may pass up positive-NPV projects rather than issue undervalued shares</li>
<li>Two key implications: (1) the cost of external financing includes the information cost of possible underpricing, and (2) debt dominates equity because |ΔN| is always less for debt than equity (debt value is less sensitive to private information)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Know About Corporate Financing Behavior: Five Facts (pp. 16-21)</h3>
<p><strong>Fact 1 — Internal vs. external equity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For all non-financial corporations 1973-1982: internally generated cash covered 62% of capital expenditures (including inventory and current assets)</li>
<li>Net new stock issues were never more than 6% of external financing</li>
<li>&quot;Anyone innocent of modern finance would find the pecking order idea entirely plausible&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact 2 — Borrowing against intangibles and growth opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firms with valuable intangible assets or growth opportunities tend to borrow less than firms holding tangible assets</li>
<li>Long &amp; Malitz: significant negative relationship between R&amp;D/advertising investment and borrowing</li>
<li>Williamson: higher market-to-replacement-cost ratio → lower debt ratio</li>
<li>Firms target BOOK debt ratios (not market ratios) because &quot;book values reflect assets-in-place&quot; while &quot;market values reflect intangibles and growth opportunities as well&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact 3 — Timing of security issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firms issue stock when prices are &quot;high&quot; — more likely to issue equity after price rises</li>
<li>Embarrassing for trade-off theory: if firm value rises, debt ratio falls, so firm should issue DEBT to rebalance</li>
<li>Equally embarrassing for pecking order: no reason for inside information to be systematically more favorable when prices are high</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact 4 — Exchange offers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Masulis (1980, 1983): stock prices rise when firms exchange debt for equity, fall when equity for debt</li>
<li>Trade-off theory: if both directions represented moves toward optimum, we'd see positive reactions both ways — but we see asymmetric reactions</li>
<li>Information effect: managers issue equity when they think stock is overvalued, debt when undervalued — predicts asymmetric reactions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact 5 — Issue or repurchase of shares:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price falls on stock issue announcements, rises on repurchase announcements</li>
<li>Consistent with pecking order (equity issuance signals overvaluation)</li>
<li>Hard for trade-off theory to explain without an information story</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three additional observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Target ratios exist:</em> Some evidence firms adjust toward targets, but R² is very low</li>
<li><em>Risk:</em> Risky firms (high beta) borrow less — limited evidence</li>
<li><em>Taxes:</em> No clear evidence that firm tax status independently affects debt policy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion and &quot;Modified Pecking Order&quot; (pp. 22-25)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;People feel comfortable with the static tradeoff story because it sounds plausible and yields an interior optimum debt ratio. It rationalizes 'moderate' borrowing. Well, the story may be moderate and plausible, but that does not make it right.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Myers proposes a &quot;modified pecking order&quot; — what he thinks is &quot;really going on&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firms avoid issuing equity (risk of underpricing or passing up positive-NPV projects)</li>
<li>They set target dividend payout ratios so normal equity investment can be funded internally</li>
<li>They also plan to cover some investment with safe debt, but restrain borrowing to maintain &quot;financial slack&quot; (reserve borrowing power for future needs)</li>
<li>Since dividends are sticky and investment fluctuates, the firm occasionally exhausts safe debt capacity and turns to riskier securities</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key implication:</strong> Observed debt ratios reflect the CUMULATIVE requirement for external financing over an extended period. A profitable firm in a slow-growth industry will end up with low debt and &quot;won't do much of anything about it.&quot; An unprofitable firm in the same industry will end up with high debt.</p>
<p><strong>Two gaps in the story:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Depends on sticky dividends but doesn't explain WHY dividends are sticky</li>
<li>Leaves unclear when and why firms issue common equity</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>On equity issuance:</strong> The firm faces two increasing costs as it moves up the pecking order: (1) higher odds of financial distress, and (2) higher odds that future positive-NPV projects will be passed up. The firm may rationally issue equity even before it's needed for immediate investment — to acquire &quot;financial slack&quot; and move down the pecking order.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Entire Framework Is What the EPS Paradigm Dissolves</h3>
<p>Myers's paper establishes the trade-off vs. pecking order debate that has structured capital structure research for 40 years. BOTH theories start from MM irrelevance and add frictions (taxes + distress costs for trade-off; information asymmetry for pecking order) to explain why firms deviate from 100% equity or 100% debt. The EPS paradigm dissolves this debate: firms lever up when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing cost, generating a negative profitability-leverage relation without ANY frictions.</p>
<h3>2. Donaldson's Quote About High P/E and Equity Issuance Is Extraordinary</h3>
<p>Donaldson (1961) found that managers refused to issue equity even when P/E ratios were &quot;very high&quot; — even though financial officers acknowledged &quot;this had been a good time to sell common.&quot; In the EPS paradigm, high P/E means LOW earnings yield, meaning equity is CHEAP. The reluctance to issue cheap equity is a deep puzzle for the EPS paradigm — unless managers feared EPS dilution from issuing shares even at high prices (because earnings from the invested proceeds might not immediately match the earnings yield the market demanded).</p>
<h3>3. Myers's &quot;Five Facts&quot; Follow from EPS Maximization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fact 1 (internal finance dominates): EPS-maximizing managers prefer internal funds because equity issuance dilutes EPS</li>
<li>Fact 2 (tangible firms borrow more): Tangible-asset firms can borrow cheaply, making debt-financed repurchases more EPS-accretive</li>
<li>Fact 3 (timing issues when prices high): When P/E is high, equity issuance is less EPS-dilutive (low earnings yield), so firms issue when the EPS cost is lowest</li>
<li>Fact 4 (asymmetric exchange offer reactions): Debt-for-equity increases EPS; equity-for-debt decreases EPS</li>
<li>Fact 5 (negative stock issue reactions, positive repurchase reactions): Issues dilute EPS, repurchases boost EPS</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. The &quot;Modified Pecking Order&quot; Is Close to EPS Maximization</h3>
<p>Myers's modified pecking order — firms use internal funds first, keep debt safe, issue equity as last resort — maps closely onto EPS maximization: (1) internal funds don't dilute EPS, (2) safe debt at low rates is EPS-accretive, (3) equity issuance dilutes EPS. The ordering is the same; the mechanism differs. Myers explains it via information asymmetry; the EPS paradigm explains it via EPS arithmetic.</p>
<h3>5. Book Value Targeting Supports EPS-Based Thinking</h3>
<p>Myers notes that firms target BOOK debt ratios, not market ratios, and explains this by saying &quot;book asset values are proxies for the values of assets in place.&quot; In the EPS paradigm, book-based targeting is natural because EARNINGS (the numerator of EPS) are an accounting concept measured against book values. Managers think in accounting terms because they manage accounting numbers (EPS).</p>
<h3>6. Myers Dismisses &quot;Managerial&quot; Theories — But That Is the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Myers explicitly excludes &quot;managerial theories which might explain firms' capital structure choices&quot; and chooses &quot;not to consider models which cut the umbilical cord that ties managers' acts to stockholders' interests.&quot; The EPS paradigm IS a managerial theory: managers maximize EPS, which is their objective function, not necessarily shareholder wealth. Myers's exclusion of this entire category from consideration is itself a significant intellectual choice.</p>
<h3>7. Miller's &quot;Neutral Mutations&quot; and the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Myers discusses Miller's idea that some financing habits are &quot;neutral mutations&quot; — they don't affect firm value, so they persist because no one cares to stop them. The EPS paradigm is NOT a neutral mutation story: EPS maximization is a specific, non-value-maximizing objective that generates systematic patterns. But Miller's observation that &quot;the habits may make managers feel better&quot; resonates: EPS maximization does make managers feel better (meeting analyst expectations, maintaining a growth narrative), even if it doesn't maximize NPV.</p>
<h3>8. The Puzzle Itself Is Artifact of the NPV Starting Point</h3>
<p>Myers frames capital structure as a &quot;puzzle&quot; because observed behavior doesn't match NPV-maximizing predictions (with or without various frictions). In the EPS paradigm, there is no puzzle: leverage follows from comparing the earnings yield to the borrowing cost. The &quot;puzzle&quot; exists only because the profession assumed the wrong objective function.</p>
