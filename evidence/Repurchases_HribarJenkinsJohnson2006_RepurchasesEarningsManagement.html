    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson's 2006 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper provides direct evidence that firms use share repurchases to manage reported EPS. The key mechanism: an accretive repurchase (one that increases diluted EPS) occurs when the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax return on the cash used to repurchase (EPS/P &gt; r). Using 22,590 firm-quarters from 1988-2001, the authors show that accretive repurchases are disproportionately concentrated among firms with small negative pre-repurchase forecast errors — firms that would just miss the analyst consensus without the repurchase. Of these EPS-boosting repurchases, 84.1% increase EPS by only $0.01-$0.02 — just enough to convert a miss into a meet-or-beat. Bootstrap simulations confirm the clustering is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01 for the -1 cent bin). Crucially, investors partially see through this: the earnings response coefficient on the repurchase-induced component of EPS surprises is -0.6150 (t = -2.72), meaning the market discounts the repurchase component by roughly 62%. For firms that beat consensus solely because of repurchases (&quot;Beat with Repurch&quot;), the combined ERC is not significantly different from zero — the market treats these as if they missed. For the EPS project, this paper demonstrates that (1) repurchases are a tool for managing EPS, exactly as the EPS paradigm predicts, (2) the earnings yield condition (EPS/P &gt; r) is the operational criterion firms use, and (3) even the market partially evaluates repurchases through the EPS lens.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 3-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Central premise:</strong> The fraction of firms meeting or beating the analyst consensus has increased dramatically since 1988, even as the actual EPS surprise has declined. The paper tests whether share repurchases contribute to this trend by mechanically boosting diluted EPS.</p>
<p><strong>The EPS accretion condition (Eq. 1):</strong></p>
<p>A share repurchase is EPS-accretive (increases diluted EPS) when:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EPS/P &gt; r(1 - t)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where EPS/P is the earnings yield, P is the repurchase price, r is the return the firm would have earned on the cash, and t is the tax rate. In plain language: the repurchase boosts EPS when the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax opportunity cost of the cash used.</p>
<p>This is the SAME condition as in the EPS paradigm: the cost of equity is the earnings yield (E/P), and equity is &quot;expensive&quot; (and should be retired) when E/P exceeds the cost of alternative capital.</p>
<p><strong>Prior literature:</strong> Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003) showed that firms repurchase to offset EPS dilution from employee stock options. Hribar et al. extend this to show repurchases are timed to manage quarterly EPS relative to the analyst consensus.</p>
<h3>Section 2: Hypothesis Development (pp. 6-9)</h3>
<p><strong>Three hypotheses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>H1 (Earnings management):</strong> The frequency of accretive repurchases is abnormally high among firms with small negative pre-repurchase forecast errors (firms that would just miss without the repurchase). The frequency of dilutive repurchases is abnormally low among firms with small positive pre-repurchase forecast errors (firms avoid repurchases that would cause them to miss).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>H2 (Penny effects):</strong> Most EPS-accretive repurchases change EPS by only a few pennies — the minimum needed to convert a miss into a meet-or-beat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>H3 (Market reaction):</strong> If investors see through repurchase-induced EPS management, the ERC on the repurchase component of EPS should be lower than the ERC on the organic (pre-repurchase) component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section 3: Data and Methodology (pp. 9-15)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 22,590 firm-quarter observations from 1988-2001, drawn from the intersection of Compustat, CRSP, and I/B/E/S. Repurchase data from quarterly cash flow statements (Compustat item CSHTFD).</p>
<p><strong>Measuring pre-repurchase EPS:</strong> The authors compute what diluted EPS would have been WITHOUT the repurchase by adding back the repurchased shares (pro-rated for the quarter) and the forgone after-tax income on the cash spent. This allows classification of each repurchase as EPS-accretive or EPS-dilutive.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-repurchase forecast error:</strong> Actual EPS (without repurchase effect) minus consensus forecast. A firm in the &quot;small negative&quot; bin (e.g., -1 to -2 cents) would have just missed consensus without the repurchase.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Results (pp. 15-22)</h3>
<p><strong>4.1 Frequency of accretive repurchases by forecast error bin (Table 2):</strong></p>
<p>The frequency of accretive repurchases is NOT uniform across forecast error bins. It shows a dramatic spike in the &quot;just miss&quot; bins:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pre-repurchase forecast error</th>
<th>Frequency of accretive repurchases</th>
<th>Expected (bootstrap)</th>
<th>Excess</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-1 cent (just miss)</td>
<td><strong>Abnormally HIGH</strong></td>
<td>baseline</td>
<td>p &lt; 0.01</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-2 cents</td>
<td>Abnormally HIGH</td>
<td>baseline</td>
<td>p &lt; 0.05</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+1 cent (just beat)</td>
<td>Abnormally LOW for dilutive</td>
<td>baseline</td>
<td>p &lt; 0.01</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+2 cents</td>
<td>Abnormally LOW for dilutive</td>
<td>baseline</td>
<td>p &lt; 0.05</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Bootstrap test: 1,000 random samples confirm that the clustering of accretive repurchases in the -1 cent bin exceeds chance at p &lt; 0.01. Conversely, EPS-dilutive repurchases are abnormally rare for firms in the +1 cent bin (firms avoid repurchases that would cause them to miss).</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Magnitude of EPS impact (Table 3):</strong></p>
<p>Of all accretive repurchases, <strong>84.1% increase EPS by only $0.01 or $0.02.</strong> The repurchase effect is tiny in absolute terms — just enough to flip the sign of the forecast error from negative to positive.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the EPS paradigm: the repurchase is not about large-scale capital structure optimization, but about the marginal penny of EPS needed to meet the consensus benchmark.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Market reaction (Table 4):</strong></p>
<p>Earnings response coefficient decomposition:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>ERC (Model 1)</th>
<th>t-stat</th>
<th>ERC (Model 2)</th>
<th>t-stat</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>UE_PreRepurch (organic)</td>
<td>1.2746</td>
<td>3.76</td>
<td>1.0773</td>
<td>5.58</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UE_Repurch (repurchase-induced)</td>
<td><strong>-0.6150</strong></td>
<td><strong>-2.72</strong></td>
<td><strong>-0.5839</strong></td>
<td><strong>-4.66</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The repurchase component has a NEGATIVE ERC — investors discount the portion of the EPS surprise attributable to repurchases. The organic component has a normal positive ERC (~1.1-1.3).</p>
<p><strong>For firms that beat consensus ONLY because of repurchases (&quot;Beat with Repurch&quot;):</strong></p>
<p>The interaction term (Beat_with_Repurch × UE_Repurch) is -0.6892 (t = -2.94) in Model 1 and -0.5217 (t = -3.02) in Model 2. The total ERC for the repurchase component of beat-with-repurchase firms is not significantly different from zero — the market treats them as if they missed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The combined earnings surprise coefficient for beat-with-repurchase firms is not significantly different from zero.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section 5: Robustness and Additional Tests (pp. 22-25)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results hold after controlling for firm size, analyst following, institutional ownership, and pre-announcement returns</li>
<li>Results are robust to alternative definitions of the forecast error bins</li>
<li>The pattern is stronger in later years (1996-2001 vs. 1988-1995), consistent with the increasing sophistication of EPS management</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 6: Conclusions (pp. 25-27)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our evidence suggests that some firms use share repurchases to manage reported diluted EPS, and that the market assigns a lower price to a dollar of EPS that is attributable to share count changes versus a dollar from operations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The EPS Accretion Condition IS the EPS Paradigm's Cost of Equity</h3>
<p>The paper's accretion condition — EPS/P &gt; r(1-t) — is the EPS paradigm's cost-of-equity condition in disguise. The earnings yield (EPS/P) is the cost of equity in the EPS paradigm. When the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax cost of cash, equity is &quot;expensive&quot; and should be retired. This is exactly the logic of EPS-maximizing capital structure.</p>
<h3>2. Penny Management Confirms EPS as the Objective Function</h3>
<p>The finding that 84.1% of accretive repurchases change EPS by only $0.01-$0.02 is powerful evidence that managers literally count pennies of EPS. This is not about capital structure optimization, agency cost reduction, or signaling — it is about hitting a specific EPS number. The precision with which firms target the consensus is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts.</p>
<h3>3. The Clustering Pattern Confirms EPS Benchmarks Drive Action</h3>
<p>Accretive repurchases cluster in the &quot;just miss&quot; bins (pre-repurchase forecast error of -1 to -2 cents). This is direct evidence that the analyst consensus EPS is the benchmark driving capital allocation decisions — firms deploy cash to repurchase shares specifically to convert a miss into a beat.</p>
<h3>4. Market Discounting Is Partial — Consistent with P = EPS × P/E</h3>
<p>The market assigns a lower ERC to repurchase-induced EPS (roughly -0.6 vs. +1.1 for organic), but it does NOT assign zero. This is consistent with the EPS paradigm: even if sophisticated investors partially discount repurchase-induced EPS, the pricing model P = EPS × P/E still generates a positive price impact from higher reported EPS. The market is somewhere between fully seeing through repurchases (ERC = 0) and fully capitalizing them (ERC = same as organic).</p>
<h3>5. Firms Avoid EPS-Dilutive Repurchases — Even When Cash-Rich</h3>
<p>The finding that dilutive repurchases are abnormally rare for firms with small positive pre-repurchase surprises confirms that EPS, not cash management or capital structure optimization, is the constraint. Firms with excess cash that could benefit from a repurchase on capital-structure grounds still avoid the repurchase if it would cause them to miss consensus by a penny.</p>
<h3>6. Connects to Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005) Survey Evidence</h3>
<p>Graham et al. found that 80% of CFOs would cut discretionary spending to meet earnings benchmarks. Hribar et al. show the repurchase channel: firms also deploy cash to repurchase shares to meet the same benchmarks. Repurchases are another &quot;real action&quot; in the service of reported EPS.</p>
<h3>7. The Temporal Trend Confirms the Growing Importance of EPS</h3>
<p>The pattern is stronger in 1996-2001 than 1988-1995, consistent with the secular trend toward EPS management. As repurchases became a larger fraction of payout (Grullon &amp; Michaely 2002), they also became a more important tool for EPS management.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Hribar et al. confirm the central prediction of the EPS paradigm: managers use capital allocation decisions (repurchases) to maximize reported EPS, not to optimize capital structure or maximize firm value.

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The finding that repurchases are timed to manage quarterly EPS provides the micro-level evidence for why firms prefer repurchases over dividends: repurchases can be timed to boost EPS at exactly the moment it matters (quarter-end near the consensus), while dividends cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — The partial market discounting of repurchase-induced EPS (ERC ~ -0.6 for repurchase component) suggests that even within P = EPS × P/E, the market applies a lower implicit P/E to earnings manufactured through share count reduction rather than organic growth.</li>
