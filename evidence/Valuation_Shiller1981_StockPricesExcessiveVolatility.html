    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Shiller's 1981 <em>American Economic Review</em> paper presents the first formal evidence that stock prices are &quot;too volatile&quot; to be rationalized by the present value of subsequent dividends. Using the S&amp;P Composite (1871-1979) and a modified Dow Jones Industrial Average (1928-1979), Shiller computes the <em>ex post</em> rational price p* — the present value of actual subsequent real dividends discounted at a constant real rate — and compares its volatility to actual price volatility. The efficient markets model implies σ(p) ≤ σ(p*), since p is the market's forecast of p* and forecasts cannot be more volatile than outcomes. The data dramatically violate this inequality: σ(p) is 5 to 13 times larger than σ(p*). Price is wildly volatile while the &quot;rational&quot; price p* is smooth. Shiller derives additional inequalities bounding the standard deviation of innovations in price (δp) and price changes (Δp) given the standard deviation of dividends, and these too are violated by factors of 5 or more. He considers whether time-varying real discount rates could explain the excess volatility but shows this would require real rates to fluctuate between approximately -4% and +14% — an implausible range. The paper was seminal in launching the &quot;excess volatility&quot; literature and was a key precursor to behavioral finance. For the EPS project, this paper is important because it challenges the present-value-of-dividends model that MM (1961) validated as one of four equivalent valuation approaches, and implicitly supports the EPS paradigm's view that prices reflect earnings capitalization (P = EPS × P/E) where P/E fluctuates with market sentiment and comps, not a rational discounting of future cash flows.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Introduction and Figures 1-2 (pp. 421-423)</h3>
<p>Shiller opens with the &quot;simple efficient markets model&quot;: real stock prices equal the present value of rationally expected future real dividends, discounted at a constant real discount rate. He then plots actual real prices (p) against <em>ex post</em> rational prices (p*) — the present value of ACTUAL subsequent dividends — for both data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Figures 1 and 2 are the most famous images in the paper:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The solid line (p, actual price) is wildly volatile</li>
<li>The dotted line (p*, rational price) is remarkably smooth</li>
<li>p* moves slowly along a trend; p swings dramatically around it</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One is struck by the smoothness and stability of the <em>ex post</em> rational price series p* when compared with the actual price series... the stock market decline of 1929 and ending in 1932 could not be rationalized in terms of subsequent dividends! Nor could it be rationalized in terms of subsequent earnings, since earnings are relevant in this model only as indicators of later dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiller notes that even the Great Depression — a massive price decline — was not matched by a comparable decline in subsequent real dividends. Real dividends were only 16-38% below their long-run growth path during 1933-1938.</p>
<h3>Section I: The Simple Efficient Markets Model (pp. 424-427)</h3>
<p><strong>The model (Eq. 2):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_t = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ^{k+1} E_t D_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where D_t is the real dividend, E_t is the expectation conditional on information at time t, and γ = 1/(1+r) is the constant real discount factor.</p>
<p><strong>Detrended form (Eq. 3):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_t = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} (λγ)^{k+1} E_t d_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where p_t and d_t are detrended (divided by the long-run exponential growth factor λ^t).</p>
<p>The mean discount rate r̄ = E(d)/E(p) is the mean dividend/price ratio.</p>
<p><strong>The ex post rational price (Eq. 4):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_t* = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ̄^{k+1} d_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the summation extends to infinity and we have only a finite sample, a terminal value assumption is needed. But with γ̄ close to 1 (γ̄ = 0.954 for data set 1), the terminal value's weight declines exponentially.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental inequality (Eq. 1):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ(p) ≤ σ(p*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since p_t = E_t(p_t*), the forecast cannot have greater variance than the thing being forecast. (Variance of forecast = variance of outcome minus variance of forecast error.)</p>
<p><strong>Innovation representation (Eq. 5):</strong></p>
<p>The innovation in price, δ_t p_t, is determined by innovations in dividends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>δ_t p_t = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ̄^{k+1} δ_t d_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where δ_t denotes the surprise (new information) at time t. This leads to inequality (11):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ(δp) ≤ σ(d) / √r̄₂</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where r̄₂ = (1+r̄)² - 1 ≈ 2r̄ is the &quot;two-period discount rate.&quot;</p>
<p>And inequality (13) for price changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ(Δp) ≤ σ(d) / √(2r̄)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section II: High Kurtosis and Infrequent Important Breaks in Information (pp. 428-429)</h3>
<p>Shiller shows that high kurtosis (fat tails) in price changes is CONSISTENT with the efficient markets model — if information arrives in infrequent large lumps, the price series will show long periods of small changes punctuated by large moves. The variance of price is bounded even with fat-tailed distributions.</p>
<p>The key insight: the model does NOT predict normally distributed price changes. It predicts bounded VARIANCE, not any particular distributional shape.</p>
<h3>Section III: Dividends or Earnings? (pp. 429-430)</h3>
<p><strong>This section is critical for the EPS paradigm.</strong> Shiller directly addresses whether earnings rather than dividends should be used in the present value model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It has been argued that the model (2) does not capture what is generally meant by efficient markets, and that the model should be replaced by a model which makes price the present value of expected earnings rather than dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiller's response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the model (2) earnings are relevant to the pricing of shares but only insofar as earnings are indicators of future dividends. Earnings are thus no different from any other economic variable which may indicate future dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no reason why price per share ought to be the present value of expected earnings per share if some earnings are retained. In fact, as Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued, such a present value formula would entail a fundamental sort of double counting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiller acknowledges MM's (1961) point that price = PV(dividends), not PV(earnings), because the earnings reinvested in the firm appear twice — once as current earnings and again as the future earnings they generate.</p>
<p>However, Shiller also notes: &quot;It is correct to include in the present value formula both earnings and the later earnings that accrue when time t earnings are reinvested.&quot; He references MM's earnings approach (Eq. 18-20 in MM 1961) where price = PV(earnings - ρ × investment).</p>
<h3>Section IV: Time-Varying Real Discount Rates (pp. 430-432)</h3>
<p><strong>Can varying discount rates explain excess volatility?</strong></p>
<p>The extended model (Eq. 14):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_t = E_t [Σ_{k=0}^{∞} D_{t+k} × Π_{j=0}^{k} 1/(1+r_{t+j})]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With time-varying rates, the model is nonlinear and the simple variance inequalities don't directly apply. Shiller linearizes (Eq. 16):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p̂_t* ≈ Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ̄^{k+1} d̂_{t+k} - [E(d)/E(r̄)] × Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ̄^{k+1} r̂_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second term shows how discount rate changes affect p*. A one percentage point increase in r̂_{t+k} reduces all future dividend terms by approximately γ̄² ≈ 1%, so the effect compounds.</p>

<p><strong>All inequalities are dramatically violated.</strong> The left-hand side (actual volatility) is always at least five times greater than the right-hand side (upper bound from the model).</p>
<p><strong>How large would discount rate variability need to be?</strong></p>
<p>Using Eq. 17, Shiller computes that the standard deviation of the real discount rate r̄ would need to be at least 4.36 percentage points for data set 1 and 7.36 for data set 2. With a mean r̄ of about 1.5-5%, a ±2σ range would put real rates between approximately <strong>-4% and +14%</strong> (data set 1) or <strong>-8% and +17%</strong> (data set 2). These are implausibly large ranges.</p>
<h3>Section V: Empirical Evidence (pp. 432-434)</h3>
<p>Shiller tests the model more formally. Regressing δ_{t+1}p_{t+1} on p_t yields significant negative coefficients: -0.1521 (t = -3.218, R² = 0.089) for data set 1 and -0.2421 (t = -2.631, R² = 0.124) for data set 2.</p>
<p>These regressions confirm that price innovations are forecastable — a direct violation of the efficient markets implication that the innovation δp should be unforecastable given current information (including the current price level).</p>
<h3>Section VI: Summary and Conclusions (pp. 434)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have seen that measures of stock price volatility over the past century appear to be far too high — five to thirteen times too high — to be attributed to new information about future real dividends if uncertainty about future dividends is measured by the sample standard deviations of real dividends around their long-run exponential growth path.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The failure of the efficient markets model is thus so dramatic that it would seem impossible to attribute the failure to such things as data errors, price index problems, or changes in tax laws.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiller acknowledges the &quot;academic&quot; escape hatch — attributing excess volatility to time-varying expected real interest rates — but notes this requires implausible volatility in real rates and &quot;relies fundamentally on unobservables and cannot be evaluated statistically.&quot;</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Excess Volatility Challenges PV(Dividends), Not Earnings Capitalization</h3>
<p>Shiller's excess volatility finding is devastating for the PV(dividends) model: prices are 5-13x too volatile relative to what dividend changes justify. But the EPS paradigm's pricing equation, P = EPS × P/E, is NOT a PV(dividends) model. It says prices reflect current/near-term earnings times a comparables-based multiple. Both EPS expectations and P/E multiples can fluctuate substantially, generating high price volatility without any contradiction. Shiller's paper undermines the DCF/PV approach while being entirely consistent with the EPS paradigm.</p>
<h3>2. P/E Fluctuation Is the &quot;Excess Volatility&quot;</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, the &quot;excess&quot; price volatility comes from P/E multiple expansion and contraction. Dividends are smooth because earnings are relatively smooth and payout ratios are sticky (Lintner 1956). But P/E multiples fluctuate with market sentiment, risk appetite, interest rates, and comparables — generating large price swings even when fundamentals (earnings and dividends) are stable. The excess volatility IS the variation in the capitalization rate.</p>
<h3>3. Shiller's Section III Dismisses the Earnings Approach — But Too Hastily</h3>
<p>Shiller cites MM (1961) to argue that P ≠ PV(earnings) because of &quot;double counting.&quot; This is correct for the DISCOUNTING version (you can't simply discount total earnings without subtracting reinvestment). But the EPS paradigm's version — P = EPS × P/E where P/E comes from comps — avoids double counting because it uses a single period's earnings, not a discounted stream. Shiller dismisses the earnings approach based on the straw man that MM themselves identified, without considering the capitalization version.</p>
<h3>4. The Time-Varying Discount Rate Escape Hatch IS Earnings Yield Variation</h3>
<p>Shiller shows that explaining excess volatility via time-varying discount rates requires real rates to fluctuate between -4% and +14%. In the EPS paradigm, the &quot;discount rate&quot; IS the earnings yield (E/P), and earnings yields DO fluctuate dramatically — from about 3% (at market peaks) to 15%+ (at market troughs). The &quot;implausibly large&quot; variation in discount rates that Shiller needs is simply the observed variation in the earnings yield. Shiller's puzzle dissolves if the discount rate is the earnings yield, not a consumption-based real rate.</p>
<h3>5. Figures 1-2 Show the EPS Paradigm in Action</h3>
<p>The smooth p* line (rational price from actual dividends) is approximately what you'd get from capitalizing a smooth earnings stream at a constant rate. The volatile p line (actual price) is what you'd get from capitalizing a variable earnings stream at a variable P/E multiple. The GAP between p and p* is the variation in the P/E multiple — exactly what the EPS paradigm says drives prices beyond what fundamental cash flows justify.</p>
<h3>6. The 1929-1932 Crash Cannot Be Rationalized by Dividends — But Perhaps by EPS</h3>
<p>Shiller notes the 1929 crash &quot;could not be rationalized in terms of subsequent dividends&quot; or earnings. But in the EPS paradigm, the crash reflects a COLLAPSE in the P/E multiple (from ~20 in 1929 to ~6 in 1932), driven by a shift in market sentiment and comparables. Earnings also fell, but the P/E contraction was the dominant force. The crash is &quot;irrational&quot; only if you assume P should track PV(dividends); it is a natural consequence of multiple contraction in the EPS paradigm.</p>
<h3>7. This Paper Launched Behavioral Finance — But the EPS Paradigm Offers a Non-Behavioral Alternative</h3>
<p>Shiller's excess volatility finding was a key stimulus for behavioral finance (Shiller 2000, <em>Irrational Exuberance</em>). The behavioral interpretation: investors are irrational, driven by sentiment and animal spirits. The EPS paradigm offers a non-behavioral alternative: investors are rational yield-seekers using comps-based P/E multiples. P/E multiples fluctuate as comps change, as interest rates move, and as market-wide sentiment shifts — but this is not &quot;irrationality.&quot; It is rational pricing using available comparables, just as real estate appraisers rationally value properties using local comps even though comps fluctuate.</p>

<li><strong>Campbell &amp; Shiller (1988)</strong> — &quot;The Dividend-Price Ratio and Expectations of Future Dividends and Discount Rates.&quot; Follow-up decomposing stock price variation into dividend expectation changes and discount rate changes. Most variation comes from discount rates — consistent with the EPS paradigm's emphasis on P/E fluctuation.</li>

<li><strong>Cochrane (2011)</strong> — &quot;Presidential Address: Discount Rates.&quot; Synthesizes the finding that most asset price variation comes from discount rate variation, not cash flow variation. The EPS paradigm says the &quot;discount rate&quot; is the earnings yield, and its variation is not a puzzle but an observable fact about comps.</li>
<li><strong>Mehra &amp; Prescott (1985)</strong> — &quot;The Equity Premium: A Puzzle.&quot; The excess volatility and the equity premium puzzle are related: both suggest the &quot;discount rate&quot; implied by prices is too volatile and too high relative to standard consumption-based models. The EPS paradigm dissolves both by replacing the consumption-based rate with the observable earnings yield.</li>
<li><strong>Collins &amp; Kothari (1989)</strong> — Show that ERCs (which reflect the capitalization rate) vary with interest rates, risk, growth, and persistence. This is direct evidence that the &quot;discount rate&quot; varies systematically, as Shiller's Section IV explores.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — Shiller's excess volatility is evidence that the PV(dividends) model fails. The EPS × P/E model explains the excess volatility: both EPS expectations and P/E multiples fluctuate, generating high price variance.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — Shiller's p* is a FORWARD-looking construct (PV of actual future dividends). It is smooth. Actual prices are volatile. The EPS paradigm says prices are BACKWARD-looking (capitalization of current/recent EPS). The gap between p and p* is the gap between backward-looking pricing and forward-looking fundamentals.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — Shiller shows that time-varying discount rates must fluctuate wildly to explain price volatility. The EPS paradigm says the &quot;discount rate&quot; IS the earnings yield, which does fluctuate wildly — from ~3% to ~15%. The equity risk premium paper should cite Shiller as evidence that the earnings yield (= cost of equity in the EPS paradigm) varies dramatically over time.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Crimes against Campbell-Shiller)</strong> — Shiller (1981) is the founding paper of the present-value relation literature. The &quot;Crimes against Campbell-Shiller&quot; paper should engage directly with Shiller's excess volatility finding and explain it through the EPS paradigm lens.</li>
