    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>MM's 1963 &quot;correction&quot; paper acknowledges a significant error in their 1958 classic: the tax advantage of debt is substantially larger than originally stated. The corrected formula — V_L = V_U + τD_L (levered firm value = unlevered firm value + tax rate × debt) — implies that every dollar of debt increases firm value by τ cents through the tax shield. The paper also provides the corrected Proposition II: the after-tax equity yield rises with leverage, but the slope is flattened by the factor (1-τ), so leverage's risk premium is smaller after taxes. Most importantly for the EPS project, the paper's &quot;after-tax earnings yield&quot; (X̄^τ/V) is explicitly defined as the firm's overall cost of capital, and it DECREASES linearly with leverage: X̄^τ/V = ρ^τ[1 - τ(D/V)]. This is the formal justification for what practitioners had always done — lever up when debt is cheap relative to the earnings yield.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Error Being Corrected (pp. 433-434)</h3>
<p>MM open by identifying the mistake in their 1958 paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The purpose of this communication is to correct an error in our paper 'The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment'... the error was in our treatment of the tax advantages of debt financing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Proposition I stated that firm values within a risk class were proportional to expected after-tax returns. This led to underestimating the tax advantage of debt. The corrected version replaces &quot;proportional to after-tax returns&quot; with the explicit tax shield capitalization.</p>
<h3>Corrected Proposition I: V_L = V_U + τD_L (pp. 434-436)</h3>
<p>The corrected valuation formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V_L = V_U + τD_L</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>V_L = market value of the levered firm</li>
<li>V_U = market value of an equivalent unlevered firm</li>
<li>τ = marginal corporate tax rate</li>
<li>D_L = market value of the debt</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the gain from leverage is τD — a dollar of debt adds τ dollars of value through the tax shield. At τ = 50% (the rate MM use in their examples), every dollar of debt adds 50 cents of firm value.</p>
<h3>The After-Tax Earnings Yield as Cost of Capital (pp. 436-438)</h3>
<p>MM define the firm's overall cost of capital as the &quot;after-tax earnings yield&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X̄^τ/V = ρ^τ[1 - τ(D/V)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>X̄^τ = expected net operating income after taxes = X̄(1-τ) + τrD</li>
<li>V = total market value (S + D)</li>
<li>ρ^τ = capitalization rate for unlevered equity streams (after tax)</li>
<li>D/V = leverage ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>This formula shows the after-tax earnings yield DECREASES linearly with leverage. The slope is -ρ^τ·τ. At 50% tax rates, moving from 0% to 50% leverage reduces the earnings yield (cost of capital) by 25%.</p>
<h3>Corrected Proposition II: Equity Yield with Taxes (pp. 438-439)</h3>
<p>The after-tax yield on equity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>π̄^τ/S = ρ^τ + (1-τ)[ρ^τ - r]D/S</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>π̄^τ = expected net income to equity after taxes</li>
<li>S = market value of equity</li>
<li>r = interest rate on debt</li>
<li>D/S = debt-to-equity ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>The key difference from the 1958 version: the leverage premium is multiplied by (1-τ). At a 50% tax rate, the risk premium from leverage is only HALF what it would be without taxes. Leverage is less &quot;costly&quot; in terms of equity risk than the original theorem implied.</p>
<h3>The Cost of Debt-Financed Investment (pp. 439-441)</h3>
<p>MM derive the marginal cost of investment financed by debt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ρ^D = ρ^τ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkable result: the required return for debt-financed investment is simply ρ^τ — the market capitalization rate for unlevered equity streams — INDEPENDENT of both the tax rate and the interest rate on debt.</p>
<p>For the WACC with a target leverage ratio L*:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ρ* = ρ^τ(1 - τL*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is lower than ρ^τ whenever there is any debt (L* &gt; 0) and taxes (τ &gt; 0).</p>
<h3>Does This Mean Maximum Debt Is Optimal? (pp. 442-443)</h3>
<p>MM explicitly address the implication that their corrected formula suggests 100% debt is optimal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our corrected version of the earlier earlier earlier earlier argument does, of course, lead to the conclusion that the tax advantages of debt are somewhat greater than we originally suggested... It may be useful to remind readers once again that the existence of a tax advantage for debt financing... does not necessarily mean that corporations should at all times seek to use the maximum possible amount of debt in their capital structures.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They cite several reasons firms don't maximize debt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limitations imposed by lenders (p. 442)</li>
<li>The need for &quot;reserve borrowing capacity&quot; (p. 442) — firms want to maintain the ability to issue debt in the future</li>
<li>Other dimensions of financing policy besides leverage</li>
<li>The possibility that personal taxes may offset corporate tax advantages (acknowledged but not developed — this becomes Miller 1977)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Worked Example (pp. 435-436)</h3>
<p>MM provide a numerical example with two firms in the same risk class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company 1: All equity, V = $1,000, expected earnings X̄ = $100, ρ^τ = 10%</li>
<li>Company 2: D = $500 at r = 4%, with τ = 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the CORRECTED formula: V_2 = $1,000 + 0.5($500) = $1,250
Under the ORIGINAL (wrong) formula: V_2 = $1,100</p>
<p>The correction adds $150 of value — a 60% larger tax shield than originally calculated.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The After-Tax Earnings Yield IS the Cost of Capital</h3>
<p>MM's corrected formula explicitly defines the after-tax earnings yield (X̄^τ/V) as the firm's cost of capital. This is precisely what the EPS paradigm claims: the earnings yield IS the cost of equity, not some CAPM-derived theoretical construct. MM have formalized the practitioner intuition — the earnings yield tells you what the market &quot;charges&quot; for equity capital.</p>
<h3>2. Leverage Reduces the Earnings Yield — The EPS Paradigm's Capital Structure Mechanism</h3>
<p>The formula X̄^τ/V = ρ^τ[1 - τ(D/V)] shows that leverage reduces the cost of capital. This is exactly the EPS paradigm's prediction: when the borrowing rate (r) is below the earnings yield (ρ^τ), debt is &quot;cheap&quot; relative to equity, and the firm should lever up. MM have now provided the formal proof that the earnings yield / borrowing rate spread drives optimal leverage — which is what practitioners had always known.</p>
<h3>3. The Tax Shield Creates an EPS Boost</h3>
<p>The tax shield (τrD) increases after-tax earnings without increasing equity. This is a direct EPS boost: τrD additional dollars of earnings on the same (or fewer, after debt-financed buybacks) shares. The MM tax correction is, mathematically, the same as the practitioner's &quot;trading on equity&quot; calculation — leverage boosts EPS when after-tax interest cost is below the earnings yield.</p>
<h3>4. Reserve Borrowing Capacity = Maintaining EPS Flexibility</h3>
<p>MM's explanation for why firms don't maximize debt — &quot;reserve borrowing capacity&quot; — is an EPS paradigm concept in disguise. Firms maintain borrowing capacity so they CAN lever up in the future when it will be EPS-accretive. The reserve is not about risk management; it's about preserving future EPS-boosting options.</p>
<h3>5. Partial Concession to Durand and the Traditionalists</h3>
<p>The 1963 correction effectively concedes Durand's (1959) point that taxes make leverage valuable. Solomon's (1963) synthesis — &quot;the cost of capital function has a shape very like that postulated in the traditional literature&quot; — was written with knowledge of this correction. The tax-adjusted MM theorem brings academic theory closer to what practitioners had always done.</p>
<h3>6. ρ^τ as the &quot;True&quot; Cost of Equity</h3>
<p>The marginal cost of debt-financed investment being ρ^τ (the unlevered equity capitalization rate) regardless of leverage is a striking result. It means there is ONE fundamental rate — the unlevered earnings yield — that governs all investment decisions. This is consistent with the EPS paradigm's view that the earnings yield is THE cost of equity, observable from the market.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — This paper corrects the original. The 1958 Proposition I (capital structure irrelevance) still holds WITHOUT taxes. The 1963 correction shows that WITH taxes, leverage increases value by τD.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1959)</strong> — Durand's critique that real-world frictions (especially taxes) invalidate MM is partly vindicated by this correction. The tax shield is larger than MM originally admitted.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's synthesis (cost of capital is U-shaped, &quot;very like the traditional literature&quot;) was informed by this correction. Solomon's Chapter IX resolution uses the tax advantage of debt as the key driver.</li>
<li><strong>Miller (1977)</strong> — Miller will argue that personal taxes offset corporate tax advantages, potentially restoring irrelevance. This is the next move in the chess game.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean's &quot;3% debt vs. 10% equity&quot; spread is now formally justified: the gap exists because of taxes (and risk), and firms SHOULD exploit it.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> — Their &quot;trading on equity&quot; is formalized by MM (1963): leverage boosts after-tax earnings to equity because interest is tax-deductible and the after-tax borrowing rate is below the equity capitalization rate.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — MM (1963) provides the formal mathematics underlying the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction: lever up when the after-tax borrowing rate is below the earnings yield. The formula X̄^τ/V = ρ^τ[1 - τ(D/V)] IS the EPS-accretive leverage condition expressed in algebraic form.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David, Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The MM tax correction amplifies the Meli paper's mechanism: falling rates reduce r while the earnings yield ρ^τ is relatively stable, widening the spread (1-τ)(ρ^τ - r), making leverage more EPS-accretive.</li>
