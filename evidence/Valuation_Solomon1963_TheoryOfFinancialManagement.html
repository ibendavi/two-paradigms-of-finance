    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Solomon's <em>The Theory of Financial Management</em> (1963), written at Stanford and funded by the Ford Foundation, is the precise document of the paradigm shift in corporate finance. Solomon explicitly identifies the OLD objective — &quot;frequently stated in terms of the maximization of long-run earnings&quot; (p. 9) — and replaces it with the NEW objective: &quot;maximize wealth or net present worth&quot; (p. 20). He names Dewing (1920) as having &quot;dominated academic works in the field for decades&quot; with a &quot;heavily descriptive&quot; approach, and credits Modigliani &amp; Miller, Joel Dean, and the Chicago school for the analytical revolution. The book was commissioned by the Ford Foundation as part of a program to transform business education from &quot;vocational&quot; to &quot;professional.&quot; This is not organic intellectual evolution — it was an institutionally funded project to change how finance was taught. Yet Solomon's practical conclusions on leverage are strikingly similar to the traditional ones: &quot;the cost of capital function has a shape very like that postulated in the traditional literature&quot; (p. 117).</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Ford Foundation Commission (Foreword, pp. vii-viii)</h3>
<p>The book opens with a foreword by Dyke Brown, Vice President of the Ford Foundation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Professor Solomon's book is one of two experimental volumes prepared at the request of The Ford Foundation as part of its program to encourage new directions in business education.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the United States, business education has undergone a far-reaching transformation during the past ten years. The predominantly vocational orientation of the past is rapidly giving way to professional curricula of a more scientific nature.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These books, it should be emphasized, are not intended as texts for students... The books are directed toward teachers of marketing and finance in the hope that they will contribute toward the enrichment of their teaching.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is crucial context: the paradigm shift was not driven by new empirical evidence or by practitioners demanding better tools. It was driven by an institutional program (Ford Foundation) to make business education more &quot;scientific&quot; — i.e., more like economics, with formal models and mathematical frameworks.</p>
<h3>The Old Paradigm Named and Described (pp. 5, 9)</h3>
<p>Solomon explicitly identifies Dewing (1920) as the founder of the old paradigm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The publication in 1920 of Arthur S. Dewing's The Financial Policy of Corporations... established the existing pattern of treatment in the field even more firmly by providing a definitive and scholarly text around which teachers could build their courses, and the book itself dominated academic works in the field for decades.&quot; (p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He quotes Mead (1910) on what the old paradigm was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One of the first texts in the field, published in 1910, states: 'Corporation...finance aims to explain and illustrate the methods employed in the promotion, capitalization, financial management, consolidation and reorganization of business corporations.'&quot; (p. ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old approach was &quot;heavily descriptive content built around the major financing episodes in the life cycle of a hypothetical enterprise&quot; (p. ix). Finance was about describing what firms DID, not prescribing what they SHOULD do.</p>
<h3>The Old Objective: Maximizing Earnings (pp. 9, 15)</h3>
<p>Solomon explicitly acknowledges what the old objective was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The goal which is generally put forward is the maximization of the present worth of those who own the enterprise — although this is frequently stated in terms of the maximization of long-run earnings.&quot; (p. 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This single sentence captures the paradigm shift. The old way: maximize long-run earnings. The new way: maximize present worth. Solomon's &quot;although&quot; is doing enormous work — it acknowledges that what was &quot;frequently stated&quot; (the operative objective) was earnings maximization, while positioning wealth maximization as the theoretically correct version.</p>
<p>Chapter II opens by identifying &quot;profit-maximization&quot; as the standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The over-all business objective which has been put forward most frequently for purposes of theoretical analysis is that of profit-maximization. This is the goal which is still assumed within the main corpus of economics.&quot; (p. 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Three Objections to Profit-Maximization (pp. 19-20)</h3>
<p>Solomon's case against the old paradigm rests on three objections:</p>
<p><strong>Objection 1: Vagueness</strong> (p. 19)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Which particular definition of profits should be maximized, short-run or long-run? the rate of profit or the amount? profits in the sense of total returns to capital? total returns to stockholders? returns to common shareholders only?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This objection is telling: Solomon identifies &quot;returns to common shareholders only&quot; as ONE possible interpretation of profit-maximization — i.e., EPS maximization. He rejects it not because it's wrong but because it's one of many possible interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>Objection 2: Timing</strong> (p. 19)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A more important objection to profit-maximization as a criterion is that it cannot help us to decide between two courses of action which offer benefits that differ with respect to their timing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Objection 3: Risk</strong> (p. 19)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The third and most important objection is that the profit-maximization criterion ignores the quality of the expected benefits.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The New Objective: V = E/k (pp. 20-21)</h3>
<p>Solomon's replacement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An alternative and useful solution is provided by the concept of wealth-maximization or net present worth maximization.&quot; (p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The gross present worth of a course of action is equal to the capitalized value of the flow of future expected benefits, discounted (or capitalized) at a rate which reflects their certainty or uncertainty.&quot; (p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the case of constant returns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;V = E/k&quot; (p. 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wealth or net present worth W is equal to gross present worth minus the amount of equity capital C required to acquire the asset... W = V - C.&quot; (p. 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In short, the operating objective for financial management is to maximize wealth or net present worth.&quot; (p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, Solomon's V = E/k formula IS the earnings capitalization formula that the old paradigm used (Dewing's &quot;ten times the net earnings,&quot; Guthmann's &quot;V = E/r&quot;). The difference is in the INTERPRETATION of k: the old paradigm derived k from market comparables (the observable capitalization rate for similar businesses); Solomon derives k from a theoretical risk-adjustment framework. Same formula, different epistemology.</p>
<h3>Solomon's Intellectual Genealogy (Preface, pp. ix-xi)</h3>
<p>Solomon names his debts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Joel Dean, whose pioneer work in capital budgeting in 1951 ushered in much of the present emphasis on this subject&quot; (p. x)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;James Lorie, Harry Roberts, and Joel Segall at the University of Chicago; to Eli Shapiro, David Durand, and Myron Gordon&quot; (p. x)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four pillars of the new paradigm: Dean (capital budgeting/NPV), Chicago school (efficient markets), Durand (cost of capital debate), and Modigliani-Miller (capital structure irrelevance).</p>
<h3>The Traditional View of Leverage (Chapter VIII, pp. 91-106)</h3>
<p>Solomon presents the pre-MM view as having three phases:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Leverage increases value</strong> (p. 94)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;increasing leverage increases market value. In this phase, k_e, the rate at which the market capitalizes net earnings, rises with increasing leverage but does not rise fast enough to offset the increase in the net earnings rate achieved through the increased use of lower cost debt capital.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This IS trading on equity — the EPS paradigm's leverage mechanism, now expressed in Solomon's k notation.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Flat range</strong> (p. 94)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After a certain degree of leverage is reached, further moderate increases in leverage have little or no effect on total market value.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Leverage decreases value</strong> (p. 95)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond acceptable limits, both k_e and k_i rise, reducing total value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solomon attributes this traditional view to Graham &amp; Dodd and Guthmann &amp; Dougall (p. 93), and notes that the evidence supports it: &quot;companies in the various industry groups appear to use leverage as if there is some optimum range appropriate to each group&quot; (p. 98).</p>
<h3>The MM Challenge (Chapter VIII, pp. 99-106)</h3>
<p>Solomon presents MM's arbitrage argument — that in perfect markets, leverage cannot affect total value — with clarity and respect. He then identifies three objections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignores tax-deductibility of interest</strong> (p. 102)</li>
<li><strong>Personal vs. corporate leverage are not equivalent</strong> (p. 102) — limited liability, margin requirements, institutional restrictions</li>
<li><strong>Extreme leverage CAN decrease value</strong> (pp. 103-104) — &quot;even if the equity market and the debt market are each perfect or nearly perfect within themselves, the securities market as a whole is highly imperfect&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solomon's Resolution: Traditional Shape, New Reasoning (Chapter IX, pp. 107-119)</h3>
<p>Solomon's conclusion synthesizes the traditional view and MM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the cost of capital function has a shape very like that postulated in the traditional literature and described earlier, although the reasons for this are not exactly those envisaged by the traditional point of view.&quot; (p. 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasoning: (1) Tax deductibility of interest DOES lower cost of capital with moderate leverage; (2) beyond acceptable limits, rising k_i offsets tax benefits. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is an optimal range of leverage as far as the cost of capital consideration is concerned&quot; (p. 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solomon even provides the quantitative framework (p. 115-116): a worked example showing how a company with $3,000 debt at 4% on $1M earnings achieves total value of $11,200 vs. $10,000 for the all-equity company — a 12% value increase from leverage via the tax shield.</p>
<h3>The Numerical Example: EPS Logic in NPV Clothing (pp. 95, 115)</h3>
<p>The table on pp. 95 and the example on p. 115 are revealing. Solomon's &quot;traditional view&quot; table shows exactly how leverage works:</p>
<ul>
<li>As debt increases from 0 to $700 (on $1,000 total capital), annual net earnings to stockholders RISE from $100 to $140</li>
<li>The equity capitalization rate rises from 10% to 14%</li>
<li>But total market value also rises (from $1,000 to $1,080 at the peak)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is EXACTLY the trading-on-equity calculation from Guthmann &amp; Dougall — leverage increases net earnings per dollar of equity invested. Solomon has simply reframed it in cost-of-capital terms.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Paradigm Shift is Documented in Real Time</h3>
<p>Solomon (1963) is the most explicit document of the transition from the old paradigm (earnings maximization) to the new paradigm (wealth maximization). He identifies the old objective, names its exemplars (Mead, Dewing), lists its deficiencies (vagueness, timing, risk), and proposes the replacement (NPV). This is the &quot;smoking gun&quot; for the maxEPS paradigm paper.</p>
<h3>2. The Shift Was Institutional, Not Empirical</h3>
<p>The Ford Foundation FUNDED the paradigm shift. Solomon was commissioned to write a new kind of finance book — one built on analytical theory rather than institutional description. No new empirical evidence drove the change. Solomon's practical conclusions about leverage are &quot;very like&quot; the traditional view. The change was in the conceptual framework, not in the predictions.</p>
<h3>3. V = E/k Is the SAME Formula Under Both Paradigms</h3>
<p>Solomon's &quot;wealth-maximization&quot; formula is V = E/k — the same earnings capitalization formula used by Dewing (&quot;ten times the net earnings&quot;), Gerstenberg (V = E/r), and Guthmann &amp; Dougall. The difference is where k comes from: in the old paradigm, k is a market-observed cap rate from comparables; in the new paradigm, k is a risk-adjusted required return derived from theory (eventually CAPM). Same formula, different epistemology.</p>
<h3>4. The Traditional View Anticipated the &quot;Correct&quot; Answer</h3>
<p>Solomon's resolution of the MM debate (optimal leverage exists, cost of capital is U-shaped/saucer-shaped due to taxes) is essentially what the traditional view already held. The traditional practitioners knew that moderate leverage was good and excessive leverage was bad. They just didn't have the formal mathematical proof that their intuition was correct. This supports the EPS paradigm's claim that practitioner methods were functional, not &quot;wrong.&quot;</p>
<h3>5. Solomon Identifies EPS Maximization as the Old Objective</h3>
<p>The key passage (p. 9): &quot;although this is frequently stated in terms of the maximization of long-run earnings.&quot; This is direct evidence that BEFORE Solomon/MM, the stated corporate objective was earnings maximization — exactly what the EPS paradigm paper documents.</p>
<h3>6. The Practical Difference Is Negligible</h3>
<p>Solomon's &quot;wealth-maximization&quot; framework produces the same capital structure recommendations as the &quot;traditional&quot; framework he replaces: moderate leverage is good, extreme leverage is bad, the optimal range depends on earnings stability. If the answers are the same, the paradigm shift was about the LANGUAGE and REASONING, not about changing what firms actually do.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Dewing (1920)</strong> — Solomon names Dewing as the founder of the old paradigm. Dewing's &quot;ten times the net earnings&quot; is the old V = E/k.</li>
<li><strong>Mead (1910)</strong> — Solomon quotes Mead's definition of corporation finance as the exemplar of the old approach.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> — Solomon cites their leverage prescriptions as representing the &quot;traditional view&quot; (p. 93).</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd</strong> — Also cited as exemplars of the traditional view on leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — The theoretical challenge that Solomon mediates. He accepts MM's logic but shows their conclusion (capital structure irrelevance) fails due to taxes and imperfect markets.</li>
<li><strong>Joel Dean (1951)</strong> — &quot;Capital Budgeting&quot; ushered in NPV-based project evaluation, which Solomon incorporates.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1952)</strong> — Presented both the &quot;net income&quot; and &quot;net operating income&quot; approaches to leverage at the NBER conference, framing the debate that MM and Solomon address.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Solomon is THE primary source for documenting the paradigm shift. His p. 9 passage directly confirms that the pre-MM objective was earnings maximization; his Ford Foundation context shows the shift was institutional; his practical conclusions show the old and new paradigms produce similar recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Solomon's traditional view of leverage (Phase 1: leverage increases value because k_e doesn't rise enough to offset cheap debt) is exactly the EPS-maximizing capital structure: borrow when the borrowing rate is below the earnings yield.</li>
