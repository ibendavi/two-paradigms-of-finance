    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Collins &amp; Kothari's 1989 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper analyzes why the stock price response to a $1 change in earnings varies across firms and over time — the &quot;earnings response coefficient&quot; (ERC). Using a discounted dividends valuation model, they derive four theoretical determinants of the ERC: (1) earnings persistence (+), (2) systematic risk/beta (−), (3) growth opportunities (+), and (4) the risk-free interest rate (−). Using NYSE firms from 1968-1982 with a reverse regression methodology, they confirm all four determinants empirically. The interest rate effect is especially strong: the temporal correlation between long-term government bond yields and aggregate ERCs is 0.73-0.85. A 15-month return measurement window (vs. 12-month) dramatically improves explanatory power, especially for large firms where prices lead earnings. The full model (year dummies, growth, risk, persistence, interest rate interactions) achieves adjusted R² of 19.4-27.3%, a 415-823% improvement over the baseline 2.5-4.0% from a simple 12-month return regression. For the EPS project, this paper is essential because it demonstrates that the market prices stocks as if capitalizing earnings — the ERC is literally the rate at which the market converts earnings changes into price changes, and its determinants (persistence, growth, risk, interest rates) are exactly the factors that would affect an earnings capitalization multiple (P/E ratio).</p>

<h3>Section 2: Equity Valuation and ERC Theory (pp. 145-153)</h3>
<p><strong>The earnings-price relation:</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental regression is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAR_it = a + b × UX_it + e_it     (Eq. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where CAR is cumulative abnormal return, UX is unexpected earnings, and b is the ERC.</p>
<p><strong>The valuation model (Eq. 4):</strong></p>
<p>Starting from a dividend discount model with clean surplus accounting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_it = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} [λ_{it+k} / (1+R_i)^k] × X_it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where λ_{it+k} is the earnings multiplier (capturing persistence and growth), R_i is the expected return, and X_it is current earnings.</p>
<p><strong>This is literally an earnings capitalization model.</strong> The price equals current earnings times a capitalization factor that depends on persistence, growth, and the discount rate.</p>
<p><strong>Four theoretical determinants of the ERC:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Table 1 — Theoretical ERCs under different ARIMA earnings processes:</strong></p>
<p>For an IMA(1,1) process with persistence parameter (1-θ):</p>
<ul>
<li>θ = 0 (random walk): ERC = 1/R (where R = discount rate)</li>
<li>θ = 0.5: ERC = (1-θ)/R = 0.5/R</li>
<li>θ = 1.0 (white noise): ERC = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>For R = 0.10: random walk ERC = 10 (a $1 earnings surprise → $10 price change). This IS the P/E ratio: the market capitalizes each permanent $1 of earnings at 1/R = P/E.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling issues (Section 2.4):</strong></p>
<p>Two scaling options for the earnings change variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>ΔX_it/P_{t-1} (scale by beginning price): preserves cross-sectional variation in the capitalization rate</li>
<li>%ΔX_it = ΔX_it/X_{t-1} (scale by beginning earnings): eliminates cross-sectional variation if the capitalization rate ρ = P/E is constant</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of scale variable is critical: if we scale by X_{t-1}, we are implicitly assuming a CONSTANT P/E ratio across firms. If the ERC varies with risk, growth, and persistence, scaling by price preserves these differences while scaling by earnings absorbs them.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Estimation Methodology (pp. 153-157)</h3>
<p><strong>Reverse regression approach:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of the &quot;standard&quot; regression (returns on earnings), Collins &amp; Kothari use reverse regression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ΔX_it/P_{t-1} = α + γ_1 × R_it + ε_it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where R_it is the stock return. The coefficient γ_1 is the &quot;return response coefficient&quot; (RRC), which is 1/ERC.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> (1) reduces errors-in-variables bias (earnings are measured with error; returns are measured accurately), (2) allows interaction terms with firm characteristics.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Holding Period and Firm Size (pp. 158-164)</h3>
<p><strong>Key finding — Return measurement window matters enormously:</strong></p>
<p>Figures 1-2 show that the association between returns and earnings changes varies dramatically with the return measurement window:</p>
<ul>
<li>For large firms: R² peaks at ~10-12% with a 15-month window starting in August of year t-1 through October of year t</li>
<li>For small firms: R² peaks slightly later (November t-1 through January t+1)</li>
<li>Conventional 12-month April-March window yields R² of only 2-4%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Prices LEAD earnings for large firms — the stock price incorporates earnings information before the earnings are reported. A 15-month window captures this anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>For the EPS paradigm:</strong> The fact that returns lead earnings by several months implies that market participants are forecasting and pricing based on EXPECTED earnings — exactly what the P = E(EPS) × P/E framework describes.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Determinants of ERCs — Empirical Evidence</h3>
<h4>6.1 Interest Rates (pp. 164-166)</h4>

</table>
<p><strong>The correlation between government bond yields and ERCs is 0.73-0.85</strong> using the price-scaled variable. When interest rates are high, the market capitalizes earnings changes at a LOWER multiple — exactly as an earnings capitalization model (P = E/r) predicts.</p>
<p><strong>For the EPS paradigm:</strong> This is direct evidence that the market uses an earnings capitalization framework. When r rises, P/E = 1/r falls, so each dollar of earnings change moves the price by less. The interest rate IS the capitalization rate.</p>
<h4>6.2 Risk and Growth (pp. 166-172)</h4>
<p><strong>Table 5 — Annual regression (Eq. 9):</strong></p>

<p>Growth: The coefficient on the MB×R interaction is −0.021 (t = −4.31). Since this is a REVERSE regression (earnings on returns), a negative coefficient means growth INCREASES the ERC. High growth firms have higher ERCs — each $1 of earnings surprise moves prices more because the market expects the earnings to grow.</p>
<p>Risk: The coefficient on β×R is 0.028 (t = 2.67). In the reverse regression, a positive coefficient on risk means higher risk DECREASES the ERC (increases the RRC = 1/ERC). Higher beta firms have lower ERCs — the market discounts their earnings more heavily.</p>

<p>The improvement from baseline to full model: <strong>R² increases by 415-823%</strong>. Despite this, 70-80% of variation remains unexplained — &quot;a substantial amount of variation (roughly, 70-80%) in accounting earnings changes is unrelated to security returns.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section 7: Summary and Implications (pp. 178-180)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper extends the empirical literature on the differences in the relation between earnings and security returns. Using a simple discounted dividends valuation model we hypothesize that the earnings response coefficient varies negatively with the risk-free interest rate and systematic risk; and it varies positively with growth prospects and earnings persistence.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Despite these dramatic improvements in overall explanatory power it is obvious that a substantial amount of variation (roughly, 70-80%) in accounting earnings changes is unrelated to security returns.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Future extensions suggested:</strong> analyze differences in market risk premia over time, include inflation, money supply, trade deficits as explanatory variables.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The ERC IS the Earnings Capitalization Rate</h3>
<p>Collins &amp; Kothari's theoretical framework (Eq. 4) is literally an earnings capitalization model: P = [capitalization factor] × X. The ERC (= b in the CAR = a + bUX regression) is the rate at which the market converts earnings surprises into price changes. For a random walk earnings process, the theoretical ERC equals 1/R = P/E — the earnings capitalization multiple. The entire paper is premised on the idea that the market prices stocks by capitalizing earnings.</p>
<h3>2. Interest Rate Effect Confirms Earnings Yield Pricing</h3>
<p>The strong temporal correlation (0.73-0.85) between government bond yields and ERCs is direct evidence for the EPS paradigm's pricing equation P = EPS/r. When interest rates rise, r rises, P/E falls, and each dollar of earnings change produces a smaller price response. The interest rate is not merely a &quot;risk factor&quot; — it is the CAPITALIZATION RATE that determines how the market prices earnings.</p>
<h3>3. The Four ERC Determinants Are the Four Determinants of P/E</h3>
<p>Collins &amp; Kothari's four ERC determinants — persistence, risk, growth, interest rates — are exactly the factors that determine the P/E ratio in the EPS paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>High persistence → high P/E (market pays more for durable earnings)</li>
<li>Low risk → high P/E (market pays more for safe earnings)</li>
<li>High growth → high P/E (market pays more for growing earnings)</li>
<li>Low interest rates → high P/E (lower alternative returns → higher capitalization rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ERC literature and the P/E literature are studying the same object from different angles.</p>
<h3>4. Scaling by Price vs. Earnings Tests the Constant P/E Assumption</h3>
<p>Collins &amp; Kothari note that scaling earnings changes by X_{t-1} (instead of P_{t-1}) eliminates cross-sectional variation if P/E is constant. Their finding that the ΔX/P_{t-1} specification preserves more cross-sectional information confirms that P/E varies systematically across firms — exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts (different firms have different P/E multiples based on their comparables and characteristics).</p>
<h3>5. Prices Lead Earnings — The Market Forecasts EPS</h3>
<p>The finding that a 15-month return window (starting before the fiscal year) dramatically outperforms a 12-month window implies that prices anticipate future earnings. This is direct evidence for the P = E(EPS) × P/E framework: investors forecast next-period EPS and price accordingly, so price changes precede reported earnings changes.</p>
<h3>6. The 70-80% Unexplained Variation Is &quot;Noise&quot; in Reported Earnings</h3>
<p>Collins &amp; Kothari acknowledge that 70-80% of variation in accounting earnings changes is unrelated to returns. In the EPS paradigm, this is because: (a) accounting earnings contain transitory components that the market ignores, and (b) the market prices EXPECTED future EPS (from analyst forecasts), not historical accounting earnings. The ERC framework is powerful but limited by the use of reported earnings rather than expected earnings.</p>
<h3>7. Connection to Cost of Capital Literature</h3>
<p>The interest rate effect on ERCs connects directly to the cost of capital literature. In the EPS paradigm, the &quot;cost of equity&quot; is the earnings yield (E/P). Collins &amp; Kothari show that the market's response to earnings varies with interest rates, confirming that the capitalization rate — which IS the earnings yield in the EPS framework — moves with the general level of rates. This validates the EPS paradigm's treatment of the earnings yield as an observable market price of equity.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — Collins &amp; Kothari's entire framework IS the P = EPS × P/E model studied from the accounting side.

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — The finding that ERCs decline with interest rates (correlation 0.73-0.85) is direct evidence that the market capitalizes current earnings at a rate related to the general level of interest rates. This is backward-looking asset pricing: investors capitalize what firms earn now, discounting at an observable rate.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — The interest rate effect on ERCs implies that the capitalization rate moves with the risk-free rate. The earnings yield = r_f + ERP, so changes in r_f pass through to the capitalization rate and hence to the ERC. This supports the &quot;People's Equity Risk Premium&quot; paper's treatment of the ERP as the spread between the earnings yield and the risk-free rate.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Collins &amp; Kothari's theoretical ERC = 1/R for random walk earnings is exactly the P/E ratio. The paper provides accounting-based evidence that the market capitalizes earnings — the foundation of the EPS paradigm's pricing equation.</li>
