    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Aubrey's 1896 London practitioner guide uses &quot;intrinsic value&quot; explicitly — distinguishing underlying worth from market price — yet provides ZERO quantitative tools to calculate it. No P/E, no earnings capitalization, no present value, no yield analysis as a valuation method. His practical advice: study past price ranges, use judgment, buy cheap. This positions Aubrey at a crucial intermediate point: the <strong>concept</strong> of fundamental value existed in practitioner thinking by 1896, but the <strong>methodology</strong> to estimate it did not. The vocabulary of value preceded its arithmetic by decades.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Explicit &quot;Intrinsic Value&quot; Concept (Ch. XXXI, p. 225)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Political complications, impending war, bad weather, a good harvest, failure in crops, the outbreak of a pestilence, a serious railway accident, storms and shipwrecks, the state of trade, and various other causes, <strong>produce fluctuations in market prices, while intrinsic values remain the same.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkably clear statement for 1896: market price fluctuates with events and psychology; intrinsic value persists independently. This is the same concept as Hutcheson's (1720) &quot;intrinsick value&quot; — continuous across 176 years.</p>
<h3>Intrinsic Value Linked to Investing vs. Trading (Ch. XXXIV, p. 238)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first [short-term trading] requires but little knowledge of the intrinsic value of stocks; their daily fluctuations only being taken into account; but the other [long-term investing], besides being much slower in working, <strong>demands greater knowledge of intrinsic values</strong>, and but little of daily fluctuations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a proto-Graham distinction: short-term trading needs only price; long-term investing requires understanding fundamental value.</p>
<h3>No Valuation Methodology</h3>
<p>Despite the intrinsic value concept, Aubrey offers NO quantitative valuation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No earnings capitalization</strong> (no V = E/r, no P/E, no multipliers)</li>
<li><strong>No present value or discounting</strong></li>
<li><strong>No dividend yield as a valuation input</strong> (dividends are mentioned as income, never as valuation data)</li>
<li><strong>No comparative yield analysis</strong> (unlike Fairman 1795, who reduced everything to yield)</li>
<li><strong>No mathematical formulas of any kind</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The &quot;Method&quot;: Study Price History (Ch. XXXI, p. 227)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Its past history, its recent fluctuations, its highest and lowest prices, with the reasons that influenced them, and the probable conditions in the near future, should be carefully and patiently investigated, so as to form a just estimate of the prospects of an early or an ultimate movement upwards or downwards.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By taking the average of prices over a series of years it is possible to make a reasonable forecast, after noting the influences which affected values.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pure chart-reading and historical-range analysis — technical analysis without the name.</p>
<h3>Price Theory: Supply, Demand, and Psychology</h3>
<p>Aubrey's theory of stock price determination:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Money supply and credit conditions</strong> — Bank Rate as the key variable</li>
<li><strong>Political events and news</strong> — wars, harvests, pestilence</li>
<li><strong>Fashion and crowd psychology</strong> — &quot;A general disposition is manifested to favour or to reject certain securities, for no particular reason, but because everybody else is doing so&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Periodicity</strong> — &quot;Nothing is more certain or remarkable than the periodicity of prices. They run in cycles.&quot; Cites Jevons and Bagehot</li>
</ol>
<h3>Investment vs. Speculation (Ch. IV, p. 36)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In theory an investment is supposed to mean comparative safety, if not absolute certainty; but an element of speculation enters into every such transaction.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The gain in this case is styled profit, while in the former case it is styled interest; but the two things are practically identical.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aubrey insists the distinction is largely semantic — all investment involves speculation. More nuanced than Crump (1874), less rigorous than Graham &amp; Dodd (1934).</p>
<h3>Behavioral Insights — Substantial</h3>
<p><strong>Buying high, selling low</strong> (p. 146-147):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When a stock has experienced a considerable rise, then, but not till then, do this class of people think of buying. In like manner, when it has greatly fallen, and probably has reached the lowest point, then, but not till then, do they sell.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Herd behavior</strong>: &quot;Man is an imitative animal who delights in bargains.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Overconfidence</strong>: &quot;To be dissatisfied with a moderate profit, risking it for the chance of gaining much more, is a sure sign of incapacity.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Panic psychology</strong>: Detailed accounts of bank runs (Birkbeck 1892) and market panics (Cleveland/Venezuela 1895).</p>
<h3>Historical Price Data</h3>
<p>Rich appendices (unprecedented for a practitioner book of this era):</p>
<ul>
<li>Appendix C: Consols prices, mean yield, Bank Rate, wheat prices 1850-1895</li>
<li>Appendix F: Highest and lowest prices for ~185 stocks, 1880-1895</li>
<li>Appendix H: Dividends paid on leading stocks, 1890-1895</li>
</ul>
<p>The data exists but is never used analytically — it's presented as reference material, not as inputs to valuation.</p>
<h3>Brief Allusion to Capitalization (p. 19)</h3>
<p>Citing Robert Giffen: national capital value is &quot;from four to thirty years' purchase&quot; of income. This is a capitalization-rate reference (P = Income × multiplier), but Aubrey does not develop or apply it to individual stocks.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Conceptual Gap of the Late 19th Century</h3>
<p>Aubrey proves that by 1896, London practitioners had:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>vocabulary</strong> of value: intrinsic value, investment vs. speculation, yield, dividend</li>
<li>But NOT the <strong>arithmetic</strong> of value: no capitalization rate, no present value, no P/E</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept that securities have a &quot;true worth&quot; distinct from market price was well established. The tools to estimate that worth were not yet invented (for equity; bond math had existed since the 1660s).</p>

<h3>3. The Present-Value Gap Deepens</h3>
<p>By 1896, PV had been known for bonds for 230+ years (de Witt 1660s). Aubrey extensively covers Consols yields. Yet applying PV to stocks is invisible. The gap is not about mathematical capability — it's about the intellectual leap of treating uncertain equity cash flows like contractual bond payments.</p>
