    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Kurt's 2018 <em>Review of Accounting and Finance</em> paper distinguishes between two motivations for accelerated share repurchases (ASRs): EPS management and signaling undervaluation. Using 293 ASR transactions from 2004-2011, Kurt identifies &quot;EPS-suspect&quot; firms -- those that would have missed the consensus EPS forecast had they not executed the ASR (29% of the sample). Key findings: (1) EPS-suspect ASR firms are more likely to have CEOs with EPS-contingent bonuses (54.8% vs. 42.1%), to be habitual EPS beaters (23.8% vs. 12.9%), and to have lower book-to-market ratios (0.606 vs. 0.682); (2) analysts revise EPS forecasts upward upon ASR announcements but the revision is temporary -- it washes out by the earnings announcement date; (3) investors are not fooled: earnings announcement returns for EPS-suspect ASR firms are 2.1 percentage points LOWER than for control ASR firms; (4) non-EPS-suspect ASR firms exhibit positive abnormal operating performance in the two years following the ASR, while EPS-suspect firms do NOT. The paper demonstrates that ASRs serve dual purposes -- genuine signaling for some firms, EPS manipulation for others -- and that the market can distinguish between the two.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Background on ASRs (pp. 456-457)</h3>
<p><strong>What is an ASR?</strong> Under an ASR contract, a firm repurchases a large block of its shares immediately from an investment bank (IB). The IB borrows the shares from institutional investors, delivers them to the firm, and then buys shares on the open market over ~5 months to replace the borrowed shares. The ASR contract is settled based on the volume-weighted average price paid.</p>
<p><strong>Key feature for EPS:</strong> An ASR leads to an IMMEDIATE decrease in shares outstanding, producing a quick boost to EPS. &quot;Implementing the repurchase earlier in the fiscal quarter or year leads to a greater reduction in the weighted average number of shares and thus a greater boost in EPS&quot; (p. 457). Losses on the ASR forward contract are recorded in equity, not income -- so any cost is hidden from the income statement.</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> US firms spent $79 billion on ASRs in 2007, representing 11% of total annual repurchase spending.</p>
<h3>Section 2.2: EPS Management Hypothesis (pp. 457-458)</h3>
<p><strong>Predictions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Firms with EPS-linked CEO bonuses and habitual EPS beaters are more likely to use ASRs for EPS management (i.e., be EPS-suspect firms)</li>
<li>ASRs initiated by EPS-suspect firms will NOT be followed by positive abnormal operating performance</li>
<li>Earnings announcement returns will be LOWER for EPS-suspect ASR firms</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key premise:</strong> Analysts do not immediately adjust their EPS forecasts for the reduced share count upon ASR announcement. This creates a window where the ASR mechanically helps the firm beat the consensus forecast.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Sample and Descriptive Statistics (Table I)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 341 ASRs identified through Factiva and SEC EDGAR, reduced to 293 after filtering. Period: 2004-2011.</p>
<p><strong>Table I, Panel A -- Time distribution:</strong> ASRs peaked in 2007 (N=84, 28.7% of sample). EPS-suspect percentage ranges from 17.2% (2006) to 50.0% (2009).</p>
<p><strong>Table I, Panel B -- Transaction characteristics:</strong> Mean ASR amount = $488.5M (median $225M). Mean percentage of equity repurchased = 5.2% (median 3.9%).</p>
<p><strong>Table I, Panel C -- Stated motivations:</strong> Undervaluation cited in 37.5% of cases; EPS benefit cited in only 3.8%. But 54.3% state NO explicit motivation. The low self-reported EPS motivation contrasts sharply with the 29% identified as EPS-suspect through the methodology -- managers don't admit to EPS management.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Identifying EPS-Suspect ASRs (pp. 459-461)</h3>
<p><strong>Methodology (following Burnett et al. 2012 and Hribar et al. 2006):</strong></p>
<p>The EPS impact of the ASR is calculated as:</p>
<ul>
<li>AS_IF_EPS = NET_INCOME / (SHARES_OUT + ASR_SHARES x w)</li>
<li>EPS_IMPACT = (NET_INCOME / SHARES_OUT) - AS_IF_EPS</li>
</ul>
<p>where w is the weighted number of days between ASR and fiscal period end.</p>
<p><strong>EPS-suspect definition:</strong> Firms where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$0.00 &lt;= ACTUAL_FE &lt;= $0.05 (beat forecast by up to 5 cents)</li>
<li>-$0.05 &lt;= AS_IF_FE &lt; $0.00 (would have MISSED forecast without ASR)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 84 of 293 ASR observations (28.7%) are EPS-suspect. The median EPS_IMPACT is 1 cent (quarterly) and 2 cents (annual).</p>

<p>EPS-suspect firms have MORE EPS-linked compensation, MORE habitual beating, LESS stated undervaluation motivation, and LOWER book-to-market (less undervalued).</p>
<p><strong>Table III -- Logistic regression (DV = EPS_SUSPECT):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EPS_BONUS: coefficient 0.839 (z=2.32, p&lt;0.05). Marginal effect: +14.8 percentage points</li>
<li>HABITUAL: coefficient 0.971 (z=2.02, p&lt;0.05). Marginal effect: +19.7 percentage points</li>

<li>Pseudo R-squared: 0.217</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 5.2: Analyst Reactions to ASR Announcements (Table IV)</h3>
<p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Analysts revise EPS forecasts upward upon ASR announcement, but the revision is TEMPORARY.</p>
<p><strong>Table IV, Panel A -- ASR fiscal quarter forecasts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Day -1 to +7: No significant change (full sample)</li>
<li>But for EPS_IMPACT &lt; 1 cent subsample: upward revision of 0.268 cents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table IV, Panel B -- Following fiscal quarter forecasts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Day -1 to +7: Upward revision of 0.460 cents (full sample, p&lt;0.01)</li>
<li>Day -1 to +30: Revision grows to 0.810 cents</li>
<li>But by day before earnings announcement: revision reverses to -3.603 cents (p&lt;0.01)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Analysts temporarily incorporate the EPS impact of ASRs into their short-term forecasts, indirectly facilitating firms' use of ASRs to meet/beat forecasts. But the revision washes out -- analysts ultimately return their forecasts to pre-ASR levels.</p>

</ul>
<p>Investors earn 2.1 percentage points LESS around earnings announcements for EPS-suspect ASR firms. &quot;These results suggest that investors are not fooled by firms' attempts to use ASRs to meet/beat consensus forecasts&quot; (p. 469).</p>

<p>Non-EPS-suspect firms show positive abnormal operating performance in 5 of 8 post-ASR quarters (p&lt;0.05). EPS-suspect firms show NO positive abnormal performance. The cumulative two-year difference is 3.9 percentage points (p&lt;0.05).</p>

<p>For non-EPS-suspect firms, ASR announcement returns are positively correlated with future operating performance -- investors capitalize expectations about signaled performance. For EPS-suspect firms, there is NO such relation.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Conclusion (pp. 472-473)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ASRs are indeed open to abuse and used opportunistically by some managers to quickly boost EPS. Investors, however, are not fooled by these managers' attempts to be 'wolves in sheep's clothing.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Managers who use ASRs to signal face genuine costs (immediate cash outlay, potential forward contract loss). But the EPS management motive undermines the credibility of the signal. Corporate boards &quot;need to be cognizant of managers' incentives for undertaking ASRs.&quot;</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Quantifies the Prevalence of EPS-Motivated ASRs</h3>
<p>29% of ASRs are EPS-suspect -- nearly one in three. This is a substantial fraction of a significant financial innovation ($79B/year in 2007). The EPS objective function is not a marginal consideration -- it drives a meaningful share of major corporate transactions.</p>
<h3>2. CEO Compensation Directly Links to EPS-Motivated ASRs</h3>
<p>The finding that EPS-contingent bonuses predict EPS-suspect ASRs (54.8% vs. 42.1%, logistic regression z=2.32) provides a direct mechanism: managers maximize EPS because their pay depends on it. This connects to Cheng et al. (2015) and the compensation literature showing that EPS is the most common performance metric in bonus plans.</p>
<h3>3. The Temporary Analyst Revision Enables EPS Management</h3>
<p>Analysts temporarily raise EPS forecasts upon ASR announcement, then reverse the revision. This creates a brief window where the ASR's EPS impact is &quot;counted&quot; -- the firm beats the (temporarily revised) consensus, and the beat is recorded in the historical data. This mechanism is subtle: it's not that analysts are fooled, but that the timing of their revisions creates a window for EPS management.</p>
<h3>4. Investors Distinguish EPS Management from Signaling</h3>
<p>The 2.1 percentage point lower earnings announcement return for EPS-suspect firms suggests investors can partially see through EPS-motivated ASRs. This is consistent with Roychowdhury (2006)'s institutional ownership finding -- sophisticated investors constrain or penalize EPS manipulation.</p>
<h3>5. ASRs as the Most Aggressive EPS-Boosting Repurchase Tool</h3>
<p>ASRs provide IMMEDIATE share count reduction, unlike open market repurchases which occur gradually. This makes them uniquely powerful as an EPS management device -- the shares are retired instantly from the denominator. The fact that managers choose this more aggressive (and expensive) tool specifically to hit EPS targets reveals the intensity of EPS focus.</p>
<h3>6. The &quot;Stated Motivation&quot; Gap Reveals EPS Taboo</h3>
<p>Only 3.8% of ASRs cite &quot;EPS benefit&quot; as the stated motivation, yet 29% are identified as EPS-suspect through the methodology. Managers don't ADMIT to EPS management even when they're doing it. This echoes Dichev et al. (2013)'s finding that CFOs acknowledge earnings management happens but are reluctant to discuss specifics.</p>
<h3>7. Habitual EPS Beaters Are More Likely to Use ASRs for EPS</h3>
<p>The HABITUAL variable (23.8% vs. 12.9%) suggests that EPS management through ASRs is part of a broader pattern of consistent EPS target-beating, not an isolated action. Firms that routinely beat EPS add ASRs to their toolkit for ensuring the streak continues.</p>

<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Document the EPS accretion condition for open market repurchases. Kurt extends this to ASRs, showing the same EPS management motivation but with a more powerful (immediate) mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Oded &amp; Michel (2008)</strong> -- &quot;Stock Repurchases and the EPS Enhancement Fallacy.&quot; Discuss accelerated repurchases as a mechanism to &quot;quickly increase EPS.&quot; Kurt provides the first large-sample evidence distinguishing EPS-motivated from signaling-motivated ASRs.</li>
<li><strong>Brav, Graham, Harvey &amp; Michaely (2005)</strong> -- &quot;Payout Policy in the 21st Century.&quot; 75% of executives say EPS increase is important for repurchase decisions. Kurt shows this motivation drives a specific repurchase innovation (ASRs) and that 29% of ASRs are directly attributable to EPS management.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> -- &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; 86% say meeting EPS benchmarks builds credibility; 78% would sacrifice long-term value for smooth earnings. Kurt documents the ASR as one tool for achieving this.</li>
<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> -- &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Show repurchases offset ESO dilution. Kurt's ESO_EXER variable controls for this but finds it does NOT differ between EPS-suspect and non-EPS-suspect ASRs -- the EPS management motive is about consensus forecasts, not just dilution offset.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> -- &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out investment. Kurt complements this by showing that EPS-motivated ASRs are followed by POOR operating performance -- consistent with the firm's resources being directed toward financial engineering rather than operations.</li>
<li><strong>Roychowdhury (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Management through Real Activities Manipulation.&quot; Shows institutional ownership constrains earnings management. Kurt's INST_OWN variable is positive in Table V (higher institutional ownership slightly increases EA returns), though not statistically significant.</li>
<li><strong>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2013)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field.&quot; CFOs acknowledge earnings management through real actions is &quot;harder to detect but often more damaging.&quot; ASRs are a real action that is easier to detect (public announcement) but whose EPS motivation is concealed (only 3.8% state it).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> -- Kurt provides direct evidence that a specific repurchase innovation (ASRs) was adopted substantially for EPS management purposes. The 29% EPS-suspect rate understates the true prevalence since many firms may use ASRs for EPS management below the 5-cent detection threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> -- The ASR is the most extreme form of EPS-maximizing payout: it delivers the EPS boost immediately, unlike gradual open market repurchases. The evolution from dividends to OMRs to ASRs represents an increasing optimization of payout for EPS impact.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> -- The invention and adoption of ASRs as a financial innovation specifically designed for rapid EPS enhancement illustrates how the financial system innovates in service of the EPS objective. ASRs did not exist before the mid-2000s; their creation reflects demand from EPS-maximizing managers for faster tools.</li>
