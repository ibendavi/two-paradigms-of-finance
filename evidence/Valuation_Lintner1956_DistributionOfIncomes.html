    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Lintner's 1956 AER paper, based on intensive field interviews with 28 companies at Harvard Business School (funded by the Rockefeller Foundation), establishes the foundational model of corporate dividend behavior. The key finding: managers set dividends using a partial adjustment model toward a target payout ratio of current earnings. The formal model is ΔD_it = a_i + c_i(D*_it - D_i(t-1)) + u_it, where D*_it = r_i × P_it (target dividend = target payout ratio × current profits). This model explains ~85% of dividend changes in the 28 companies studied. Critically for the EPS project, Lintner documents that (1) current earnings are &quot;almost invariably the starting point&quot; for dividend decisions; (2) managers think in terms of the EXISTING dividend rate, not an optimal level; (3) the cost of equity capital or long-term debt &quot;generally did not enter&quot; into dividend decisions; (4) dividends are managed to avoid cutting the rate, creating &quot;sticky&quot; payouts that are the cornerstone of the pecking order; and (5) managers explicitly viewed themselves as having a fiduciary obligation to share earnings increases with stockholders.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Field Study Method (pp. 97-99)</h3>
<p>Lintner's study is distinctive for its empirical methodology — intensive field interviews, not econometric tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After a careful review of both the academic and nonacademic literature on corporate financial policies and the School's case files, we made up a list of some fifteen readily observable factors and characteristics that appeared to reflect or might be expected to have an important bearing on dividend payments and policy.&quot; (p. 98)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 600+ listed companies, 28 were selected for detailed study. For each, &quot;we held interviews with from two to five responsible officials, including presidents, financial vice-presidents, treasurers, controllers, and directors.&quot; (p. 99)</p>
<p>The companies were deliberately diverse: 10 with gross plant &gt;300% of 1945 levels, 5 under 100%; 4 paying &gt;70% of earnings, 12 &lt;40%; 6 using no external financing, 5 using outside funds for &gt;40% of investment.</p>
<h3>The Central Findings from Interviews (pp. 99-102)</h3>
<p><strong>Finding 1: The existing dividend rate is the anchor (p. 99)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In studying 196 company-years of dividend action (28 companies, seven years, 1947-1953), we found no instance in which the question of how much should be paid in a given quarter or year was considered without regard to the existing rate of payment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision variable is the CHANGE in the rate, not the level. Managers ask &quot;should we raise/lower the existing rate?&quot; — never &quot;what should the rate be from scratch?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Finding 2: Current earnings dominate all other factors (pp. 100-102)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Current net earnings meet these conditions better than any other factor. Earnings are reported frequently and receive wide publicity in the financial press. Most officers and directors regarded their stockholders as having a proprietary interest in earnings.&quot; (p. 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the level of current earnings was almost invariably the starting point in management's consideration of whether dividends should be changed&quot; (pp. 101-102)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;in less than five percent of the company-years studied... dividend decisions were dominated by such considerations rather than by earnings&quot; (p. 101)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding 3: Management felt a fiduciary obligation to share earnings (p. 100)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The managements we interviewed very generally believed that, unless there were other compelling reasons to the contrary, their fiduciary responsibilities and standards of fairness required them to distribute part of any substantial increase in earnings to the stockholders in dividends.&quot; (p. 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Even the executives in the minority who were most inclined to view the interests of the company as distinct from those of the stockholders... were generally concerned with the decline in favorable proxies and in the weakening of their personal positions which they believed would follow any failure to reflect a 'fair share' of such added earnings in dividends.&quot; (p. 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding 4: Partial adjustment — smoothing (pp. 100, 102-103)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;these elements of inertia and conservatism and effort to avoid erratic changes in rates very generally resulted in the development of reasonably consistent patterns of behavior in dividend decisions.&quot; (p. 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The principal device used to achieve this consistent pattern was a practice or policy of changing in any given year by only part of the amounts which were indicated by changes in current financial figures.&quot; (p. 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speed of adjustment varied: some companies made full adjustments within each year, while &quot;most of the others generally sought to move some part of the way within each year... the fraction generally 'made up' in each year varied from one-half to as little as one-fifth or one-sixth.&quot; (p. 103)</p>
<p><strong>Finding 5: Target payout ratios (p. 102)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The target pay-out ratios varied from a low of 20 per cent to a high of 80 per cent, with 50 per cent the most common figure and most of the other companies aiming at 40 or 60 per cent.&quot; (p. 102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two-thirds of companies had &quot;a rather definite policy or a rather clear understanding that dividends should be adjusted by some fraction of the difference between the last period's payment and the rate which would be indicated by applying the target pay-out ratio to current profits.&quot; (p. 102)</p>
<p><strong>Finding 6: The cost of capital did NOT enter dividend decisions (p. 104, fn. 4)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cost of equity capital or long-term debt generally did not enter into either the establishment of the policy or in particular dividend decisions in companies which as a matter of policy would not go to the market for long-term capital. In the others it entered only as a long-term average and often rather vaguely... We found no case where the cost at a particular time entered directly into a current dividend decision.&quot; (p. 104, fn. 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is devastating for the NPV paradigm: the COST OF CAPITAL — the centerpiece of MM and all subsequent theory — plays NO ROLE in actual dividend decisions. Managers set dividends based on earnings, not on the cost of equity.</p>
<h3>The Formal Model (pp. 107-108)</h3>
<p>Lintner formalizes the interview findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) ΔD_it = a_i + c_i(D*_it - D_i(t-1)) + u_it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>D*_it = r_i × P_it (target dividend = target payout ratio × current profits)</li>
<li>c_i = speed of adjustment (fraction of gap closed each year)</li>
<li>a_i = constant (generally positive, reflecting reluctance to cut dividends)</li>
<li>u_it = error term</li>
</ul>
<p>Equivalently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) D_it = a_it + b × P_it + d × D_i(t-1) + u_it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where b = cr and d = (1-c).</p>
<h3>Model Performance (pp. 108-111)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;about 85 per cent of the company-years of dividend action studied in this group of twenty-eight companies can be explained in terms of this model with only moderate discrepancies&quot; (p. 108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-six of 28 companies had definite r_i values; twenty had definite c_i values. Among the 26 stable companies, both r_i and c_i &quot;were unchanged in the postwar period&quot; with rare exceptions.</p>
<h3>Aggregate-Level Tests: Prewar Equations Predict Postwar (pp. 109-112)</h3>
<p>Lintner fits the model to aggregate data (all U.S. corporations):</p>
<p>Prewar equations (1918-41, excluding 1936-37):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D = 352.3 + .15 P_w + .70 D-1 (with inventory adjustment)
D = 106.0 + .145 P_n + .788 D-1 (without inventory adjustment)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These prewar equations &quot;predict the nine years of postwar data as revised with an average algebraic error of -163.7 million dollars (which is a 2.0 per cent underestimate of actual average dividends and a 2.2 per cent overestimate of actual retained earnings)&quot; (p. 109).</p>
<p>The model fitted to prewar data predicted postwar dividends within 2% — a remarkable out-of-sample performance across the structural break of WWII.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows Lintner's model outperforms: (1) naive model (D_t = D_t-1), (2) Modigliani's savings-income model, (3) current/lagged profits models, and (4) Dobrovolsky's book-value-based model.</p>
<h3>The Marginal Propensity to Save (p. 113)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the aggregate marginal propensity to save ceteris paribus has had a high stabilizing value of approximately 85 per cent. The year-to-year mps implied by our equations is somewhat lower... the (asymptotic) long-run mps is only on the order of 40 per cent in view of the apparently stable weighted average target pay-out ratio of about 60 per cent.&quot; (p. 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Investment Does NOT Drive Dividends (p. 112)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;plant and equipment outlays, or capital outlays less depreciation, or the first differences in either of these, in no case gives a statistically significant regression coefficient with the appropriate negative sign on dividends&quot; (p. 112)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This directly contradicts the NPV paradigm's prediction that firms should set dividends residually (pay out what's left after optimal investment). Investment and dividends are determined independently: dividends follow earnings and their own past levels, not investment needs.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Earnings Drive Dividends — Not the Cost of Capital, Not Investment</h3>
<p>Lintner's most important finding for the EPS project is the negative one: the cost of capital &quot;generally did not enter&quot; dividend decisions (fn. 4, p. 104), and investment had no significant effect on dividends (p. 112). In the NPV paradigm, both the cost of capital and investment opportunities should be primary inputs. In the EPS paradigm, dividends are a function of earnings — and that's exactly what Lintner documents. ΔD = f(earnings, lagged dividend) — no cost-of-capital term, no investment term.</p>
<h3>2. The Target Payout Ratio IS an Earnings-Based Rule</h3>
<p>The model D* = r × P (target dividend = target payout ratio × current profits) is an earnings-based rule, not an optimization over cash flows and discount rates. The manager says &quot;pay out 50% of earnings&quot; — not &quot;maximize the present value of future dividends given the firm's investment opportunity set and required return.&quot;</p>
<h3>3. Dividend Smoothing Creates &quot;Sticky&quot; Payouts — The EPS Constraint</h3>
<p>Managers' reluctance to cut dividends (a_i &gt; 0, partial adjustment) means that once a dividend level is established, it becomes a floor. This creates a constraint: earnings must be high enough to sustain the current dividend AND fund investment. If earnings fall, the firm faces a painful choice between cutting dividends (damaging the stock price) or cutting investment (reducing future earnings). This is the EPS paradigm's dividend constraint.</p>
<h3>4. Managers Think in Terms of Earnings Per Share</h3>
<p>Lintner's finding that &quot;standards and objectives were established in terms of earnings as reported to stockholders&quot; (p. 107) and that &quot;the standards ran in terms of net earnings&quot; (p. 107) confirms that the operative metric is EARNINGS. The partial adjustment model adjusts dividends toward a fraction of EARNINGS — the decision is inherently EPS-driven.</p>
<h3>5. Fiduciary Obligation = Earnings Sharing</h3>
<p>Managers' belief that &quot;their fiduciary responsibilities and standards of fairness required them to distribute part of any substantial increase in earnings to the stockholders&quot; (p. 100) reveals the operative paradigm: earnings BELONG to shareholders, and a &quot;fair share&quot; must be distributed. This is the old-paradigm view that Berle &amp; Means documented: profits are the inducement to risk capital.</p>
<h3>6. The Model That Still Works</h3>
<p>Myers (1984) will note that &quot;John Lintner's model of how firms set dividends dates back to 1956, and it still seems to work.&quot; This model, derived from observing actual managerial behavior, has outlasted every theoretical model of dividend policy. The EPS paradigm's claim — that observing what managers DO is more informative than theorizing about what they SHOULD do — is vindicated by Lintner's enduring model.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — Myers opens his &quot;Capital Structure Puzzle&quot; by noting &quot;John Lintner's model of how firms set dividends dates back to 1956, and it still seems to work.&quot; Lintner's success is contrasted with the failure of capital structure theories.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — MM's dividend irrelevance theorem contradicts Lintner's finding that dividend policy matters to managers and markets. Lintner's field evidence predates MM's theory.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon (1959)</strong> — Gordon's finding that dividends are valued more than retained earnings is consistent with Lintner's observation that managers believe &quot;the market puts a premium on stability or gradual growth in rate.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean documented the &quot;aversion to external financing&quot; and the pecking order 5 years before Lintner. Lintner's model shows dividends are set BEFORE investment is considered.</li>
<li><strong>Berle &amp; Means (1932)</strong> — Lintner's finding that managers feel a fiduciary obligation to share earnings echoes Berle &amp; Means's insight that profits serve as &quot;inducement to risk capital.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984)</strong> — Myers &amp; Majluf provide the theoretical justification (information asymmetry) for the pecking order that Lintner documents empirically. But Lintner's explanation is simpler: managers smooth dividends because that's what good management requires.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Harvey (2001)</strong> — Graham &amp; Harvey's survey confirms Lintner's findings 45 years later: managers still smooth dividends and target payout ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — Lintner is THE empirical foundation for the EPS paradigm's dividend theory. His model (ΔD = f(earnings, lagged D)) is the EPS-based dividend rule. The absence of cost-of-capital and investment terms from the model confirms that dividends are an earnings-sharing mechanism, not an NPV optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Lintner's finding that the cost of capital doesn't enter dividend decisions supports the broader EPS paradigm: managers don't use required returns from CAPM; they use earnings as the input for all financial decisions.</li>
