    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Durand's AER comment on MM (1958) is the most substantive early critique of the capital structure irrelevance theorem. Writing from MIT (he had moved from NBER), Durand does NOT deny MM's logic within their theoretical framework — he systematically demolishes its applicability to the real world. His five objections are: (1) true arbitrage between levered and unlevered firms is practically impossible; (2) margin restrictions prevent investors from replicating corporate leverage; (3) personal leverage is riskier than corporate leverage due to limited liability; (4) retention and growth destroy the concept of &quot;equivalent return class&quot;; (5) stocks don't sell at book value, so MM's growth/retention argument fails. Most strikingly, Durand argues that CORPORATIONS, not investors, are the natural arbitrageurs — and that corporate capital structure decisions ARE the equilibrating mechanism that MM's theory ignores. He also provides direct evidence for the EPS paradigm: firms should exploit the earnings yield / bond yield spread by leveraging up when equity is &quot;expensive.&quot;</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Overview of Durand's Strategy (p. 640)</h3>
<p>Durand accepts MM's logic in theory but challenges the assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper will not attempt to deny these propositions in their own properly limited theoretical context. Instead, it will analyze MM's underlying assumptions, which are subtle and restrictive; and it will indicate some of the difficulties of using these assumptions to support 'an operational definition of the cost of capital and a workable theory of investment.'&quot; (p. 640)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He identifies four devices needed for Proposition I: (1) arbitrage possible between securities in equivalent return class, (2) &quot;firm&quot; is a hybrid entity unlike any real legal form, (3) risk excluded, (4) stocks sell at book value. &quot;MM have accepted none of them wholeheartedly.&quot; (p. 640)</p>
<h3>I. The Petrolease/Leverfund Example: Arbitrage Doesn't Work (pp. 641-644)</h3>
<p>Durand constructs an elaborate example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petrolease</strong>: Oil leasing company, earns $10/share, pays all as dividends, stock at $160</li>
<li><strong>Leverfund</strong>: Open-end trust holding one Petrolease share + one $100 bond at 5%, stock at $68</li>
<li>Combined income equivalence: Petrolease share = Leverfund share + bond</li>
</ul>
<p>He shows that while these two are income-equivalent in the Petrolease/Leverfund case, MM's arbitrage argument fails for real corporations (Closecorp) because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Closecorp cannot issue or redeem securities at will like Leverfund</li>
<li>A leveraged position in Petrolease on margin is NOT equivalent to holding Closecorp stock</li>
<li>Market segmentation means high-leverage stocks can command a <strong>premium</strong>, not a discount</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Earnings Yield / Bond Yield Spread as Capital Structure Driver (p. 644)</h3>
<p>A passage of paramount importance for the EPS project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the stock market decline in September 1946 inaugurated a period of several years in which bond yields were low and stock yields were high. For the first quarter of 1950... Standard and Poor's reported yields of 2.6 per cent for high-grade utility bonds as against dividend yields of 5.35 and earnings yields of 8.1 per cent for utility stocks. Those levels offered corporations a golden opportunity to finance with bonds.&quot; (p. 644)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nine years later, in the first quarter of 1959, bond yields were up to 4.3 per cent, while dividend yields and earnings yields were down to 3.9 and 5.4 per cent.&quot; (p. 644)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is EXACTLY the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction: when the earnings yield (8.1%) far exceeds the bond rate (2.6%), equity is expensive relative to debt, and firms should lever up. The spread narrowing from 5.5% (1950) to 1.1% (1959) explains why leverage behavior changed. Durand treats this as an obvious fact about corporate practice.</p>
<h3>II. Margin Restrictions Prevent Investor Arbitrage (pp. 644-646)</h3>
<p>Durand's second objection: MM assume investors can replicate corporate leverage via margin buying, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Margin requirements under Regulation T can place a very substantial legal limitation on the volume of corrective margin switching that investors can generate.&quot; (p. 645)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Institutional investors — mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds — are largely prohibited from margin buying. &quot;Together these institutional investors command a tremendous volume of investable or invested funds, most of which are simply not available for the purchase of low-leverage shares, even when they fall to a discount.&quot; (p. 645)</p>
<h3>Corporations as the True Arbitrageurs (pp. 645-646)</h3>
<p>Durand's most profound insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;we regard the financing operations of nonfinancial corporations as an integral part of any equilibrating process that may be in operation. Even though corporations cannot act with the speed of a floor trader or of an aggressive investor, they can deal in large sums when they do act.&quot; (p. 646)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the devastating paradox (p. 653):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If MM wish to assume a perfectly free market, they should realize that corporations unhampered by the practical costs and delays of issuing or redeeming securities can immediately exploit any departure from equilibrium, and it is then arguable that investors can never profit by switching accounts because corporate financing activities will maintain an equilibrium in which profitable switching is impossible.&quot; (p. 653)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;MM, however, advise corporations that there is no opportunity to reduce cost of capital by judicious adjustment of capital structure; and thus they promote complacency, a form of market imperfection.&quot; (p. 653)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a brilliant logical trap: if markets are perfect, CORPORATIONS should be the arbitrageurs — issuing debt when debt is cheap, buying back equity when equity is expensive. But MM's theorem tells corporations NOT to do this (capital structure is irrelevant). So MM's own theorem prevents the arbitrage that their theorem requires!</p>
<h3>III. Personal Leverage ≠ Corporate Leverage (pp. 646-647)</h3>
<p>Durand argues that limited liability makes corporate leverage fundamentally different from personal leverage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;as a corporate stockholder, the leverage-loving investor with 300 shares of Closecorp at 68 enjoys most of the benefits of a levered position in Petrolease without all of the attendant risks; for he has limited his liability to the amount of his investment, $20,400.&quot; (p. 646)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the investor switches to Petrolease on margin (following MM's advice), &quot;he incurs a liability of $34,000 for his margin loan, and his maximum loss increases to $54,400&quot; — nearly three times the corporate leverage case.</p>
<h3>IV. Retention and Growth Destroy Equivalent Return Classes (pp. 647-649)</h3>
<p>Durand's most technically sophisticated argument. Two firms start identically (same earnings rate ρ*, same book value B₀), but once one retains and reinvests earnings profitably (at rate ρ* &gt; ρₖ), &quot;its assets and earnings will begin to increase, and this will suffice to transfer it into a new class, since its earnings per share will now be imperfectly correlated with those of the other corporation.&quot; (p. 647)</p>
<p>The required stock price to satisfy both conditions (maintaining EPS and equating retained earnings to stock issuance proceeds) involves the formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_f = Aρ*(1 - X) / (ρₖ - ρ*X)N (equation 3, p. 648)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This price is independent of retentions ONLY when ρ* = ρₖ (return on investment equals the capitalization rate). When ρ* &gt; ρₖ, price exceeds book value and approaches infinity as ρ*X approaches ρₖ. Durand notes that Williams (1938) suggested growth formulae that avoid these absurdities.</p>
<h3>Empirical Evidence: Price Depends on Earnings, Book Value, AND Dividends (pp. 649-651)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 1</strong> — 25 large bank stocks (NYC, early 1953):</p>
<ul>
<li>log P = .07 + .97 log B (R² residual: .151)</li>
<li>log P = .54 + .49 log B + .54 log E (R² residual: .094)</li>
<li>log P = .96 + .22 log B + .91 log E + .70 log D/E (R² residual: .036)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding the dividend/earnings ratio reduces residual sum of squares by 62% — dividends matter for pricing, contradicting MM's dividend irrelevance.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2</strong> — Four groups of 20 utility stocks (early 1955):</p>
<ul>
<li>D/E ratio is significant in 2 of 4 groups and combined</li>
<li>P/B depends on E/B and D/E jointly</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. Problems of Empirical Analysis (pp. 651-653)</h3>
<p>Durand argues MM's cross-sectional evidence is too noisy to be useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The influence, if any, of leverage on cost of capital has so far escaped detection in cross sections... the ratio of 'total earnings after taxes' to 'market value of all securities' ranges roughly from 4¼ to 7½ per cent, with well over a third of the observations falling outside the range from 5 to 6½ per cent. In the face of so much scatter, could anyone be assured of detecting a consistent variation of, say, ¼ per cent?&quot; (p. 652)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>VI. Conclusion: Static vs. Dynamic (pp. 653-654)</h3>
<p>Durand's final assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;MM have cut out for themselves the extremely difficult, if not impossible, task of being pure and practical at the same time.&quot; (p. 653)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;MM's approach to the cost of capital, as a ratio of current earnings to market price, is essentially static. Dynamically speaking, the cost of capital should measure the inducement — in terms of current earnings plus long-term growth potential — required to attract new investment fast enough to meet the needs of an expanding economy.&quot; (p. 654)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is not easy to formulate an operational definition of the cost of capital for a dynamic economy where markets are imperfect, where price-to-book value ratios vary from one-tenth to seven, and where investors and their advisory services discriminate between income and appreciation.&quot; (p. 654)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>MM's Reply (p. 655, beginning)</h3>
<p>MM's reply (which continues beyond the pages read) opens by noting &quot;the considerable areas of agreement between Durand and us which are easy to overlook in critical exchanges of this kind&quot; — specifically, Durand agrees that (1) MM's conclusions are valid &quot;in their own properly limited theoretical context&quot; (p. 640) and (2) leverage's empirical effect has &quot;so far escaped detection&quot; (p. 652).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Corporations as Arbitrageurs = EPS-Maximizing Capital Structure</h3>
<p>Durand's insight (p. 653) that corporations are the natural arbitrageurs is precisely the EPS paradigm's capital structure mechanism. When the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate, firms issue debt and retire equity — not because of MM's &quot;home-made leverage&quot; arbitrage by investors, but because managers pursuing EPS maximization exploit the spread. Durand sees this clearly but frames it as a critique of MM rather than as an alternative paradigm.</p>
<h3>2. The Earnings Yield / Bond Yield Spread Drives Leverage Decisions</h3>
<p>Durand's p. 644 passage — firms exploiting the 8.1% stock yield vs. 2.6% bond yield spread in 1950 — is a direct empirical example of the EPS paradigm's prediction. This is the same mechanism documented in the Ben-David, Chinco, Meli paper on how falling rates since 2000 made debt-financed buybacks EPS-accretive.</p>
<h3>3. Growth Destroys &quot;Equivalent Return Classes&quot; — The EPS Non-Dilution Problem</h3>
<p>Durand's Section IV shows that growth (retention + reinvestment) changes earnings per share and therefore changes the firm's risk class. This is precisely the problem that EPS-maximizing managers face: any action that changes EPS changes the firm's position in the market's P/E ranking.</p>
<h3>4. MM's Theory is Self-Defeating</h3>
<p>The paradox Durand identifies: if MM tell corporations capital structure doesn't matter, corporations stop adjusting capital structure, which means the corporate arbitrage mechanism that would enforce Proposition I ceases to operate. This is an argument for ACTIVE capital structure management — exactly what EPS maximization produces.</p>
<h3>5. The Debate Was About Practice, Not Just Theory</h3>
<p>Durand was at MIT, had consulted on bank valuations, and approached the problem empirically. His objections are ALL about real-world applicability: margin restrictions, limited liability, growth dynamics, data noise. He represents the practitioner-academic tradition that valued empirical observation over theoretical elegance.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Durand (1952)</strong> — The 1952 conference paper presented the NI vs. NOI framework; this 1959 comment defends the NI Method against MM's proof that NOI is correct. Together, they frame the complete pre-MM vs. post-MM debate.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — This paper is a direct critique. Durand accepts MM's logic but denies its real-world applicability on five grounds.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1963)</strong> — MM's tax correction, adding the tax shield, partly concedes Durand's point that taxes make leverage valuable.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's synthesis (&quot;very like the traditional literature&quot;) essentially adopts Durand's middle-ground position: an optimal leverage range exists due to taxes and market imperfections.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean's 3% debt vs. 10% equity is the same spread that Durand documents empirically (2.6% bond yield vs. 8.1% earnings yield in 1950).</li>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — Durand's point about corporate arbitrage (firms exploit the EY/bond spread) is the active capital structure management that agency theory would later attribute to manager-shareholder conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Durand's &quot;corporations as arbitrageurs&quot; = EPS-maximizing capital structure management. Firms issue debt when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David, Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — Durand's 1950 vs. 1959 comparison (spread narrowing from 5.5% to 1.1%) is exactly the time-series mechanism the Meli paper documents for the post-2000 period.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and monetary policy)</strong> — Durand (1959) p. 644 shows how the bond yield / earnings yield spread changes with monetary conditions, directly affecting corporate leverage decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1957)</strong> — &quot;Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox&quot; (cited in references) — Durand's exploration of the relationship between growth and stock prices, relevant to the critique of MM's growth assumptions.</li>
