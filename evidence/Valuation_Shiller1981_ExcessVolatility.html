    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Shiller's 1981 AER paper delivers a devastating variance-bounds test against the efficient markets hypothesis: stock prices are <strong>five to thirteen times too volatile</strong> to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends. If stock prices equal the present value of expected future dividends (the EMH model), then actual prices p should be less volatile than the &quot;ex post rational price&quot; p* (the present value of actual subsequent dividends). Formally: <em><em>σ(p) ≤ σ(p</em>)</em>*. But the data show the opposite — p is wildly volatile while p* is remarkably smooth. Using two datasets (S&amp;P 1871-1979, modified DJIA 1928-1979), the variance bound is violated by factors of 5-13x. The paper concludes that &quot;measures of stock price volatility over the past century appear to be far too high — five to thirteen times too high — to be attributed to new information about future real dividends.&quot; This was the opening salvo of the &quot;excess volatility&quot; literature and one of the strongest early challenges to the EMH.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Efficient Markets Model (pp. 421-423)</h3>
<p>The simple efficient markets model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P_t = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} γ^{k+1} E_t(d_{t+k})</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where P_t is the real stock price, d_t is the real dividend, γ = 1/(1+r) is the discount factor, and E_t denotes the expectation conditional on information available at time t. The discount rate r is assumed constant.</p>
<p>Define the <strong>ex post rational price</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p*<em>t = Σ</em>{k=0}^{∞} γ^{k+1} d_{t+k}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the stock price WOULD have been if investors had perfect foresight about future dividends. Since p_t = E_t(p*_t), p is a forecast of p*, and <strong>a forecast cannot be more volatile than the thing being forecast</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>σ(p) ≤ σ(p</em>)</em>*    — Inequality (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the variance bound. If the EMH holds, actual prices should be smoother than p*.</p>
<h3>The Iconic Evidence: Figures 1 and 2 (pp. 422-423)</h3>
<p>The paper's most powerful evidence is visual:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figure 1</strong> (S&amp;P, 1871-1979): p* is a smooth, gently trending series. The actual price p swings wildly around it — booms and busts that dwarf the underlying dividend fundamentals.</li>
<li><strong>Figure 2</strong> (DJIA, 1928-1979): Same pattern. p* is smooth; p is volatile.</li>
</ul>
<p>The visual evidence is immediate and devastating: how can price movements this large be &quot;justified&quot; by the smooth evolution of actual dividends?</p>
<h3>Innovation Form and Formal Tests (pp. 424-426)</h3>
<p>Shiller reformulates the variance bound in &quot;innovation&quot; form. Define:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u_t = p*<em>t - E</em>{t-1}(p*_t)    — the &quot;innovation&quot; in p*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ(Δp) ≤ σ(u)    — Inequality (11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ(Δp) ≤ σ(d)/√(2r̄)    — Inequality (13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where Δp is the change in detrended price.</p>
<h3>Table 2: The Violations (p. 431)</h3>
<p>The key quantitative results for both datasets:</p>
<p><strong>Data Set 1 (S&amp;P, 1871-1979):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>σ(p) = 50.12; σ(p*) = 8.968 — <strong>ratio 5.6x</strong></li>
<li>σ(Δp) = 25.57; min(σ) from inequality = 23.01 (marginally violated)</li>
<li>σ(Δp) = 25.24; min(σ) from inequality (13) = 22.71</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Set 2 (Modified DJIA, 1928-1979):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>σ(p) = 355.9; σ(p*) = 26.80 — <strong>ratio 13.3x</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The variance bound σ(p) ≤ σ(p*) is violated by a factor of <strong>5 to 13 times</strong>. The left-hand side of the inequality is always &quot;at least five times higher than the right-hand side, and as much as thirteen times as great.&quot;</p>
<h3>Dividends vs. Earnings (pp. 426-427)</h3>
<p>A key methodological point: the test uses <strong>dividends</strong>, not earnings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earnings are an &quot;accounting concept&quot; while dividends are &quot;real money&quot; paid to shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present value model is about cash flows (dividends), not accounting numbers (earnings). This grounds the test in actual cash distributions rather than manipulable accounting figures.</p>
<h3>Time-Varying Discount Rates Defense (pp. 427-431)</h3>
<p>The main escape route for EMH defenders: perhaps discount rates (expected real interest rates) vary enough to explain the volatility.</p>
<p>Shiller's response (using inequality 17 and Table 2): for time-varying discount rates to explain the volatility, real interest rates would need standard deviations of <strong>4.36 to 7.36 percentage points</strong> — implying real rates ranging from roughly -4% to +14%. &quot;These are very large numbers.&quot; While time-varying discount rates could explain SOME excess volatility, the magnitude required seems implausible.</p>
<p>Using commercial paper rates as a proxy for time-varying discount rates, the correlation between p* computed with constant rates and p* computed with actual rates is <strong>0.996</strong> — the two series are nearly identical. &quot;Thus the linearization (16) can be quite accurate.&quot;</p>
<h3>Summary and Conclusions (p. 434)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have seen that measures of stock price volatility over the past century appear to be far too high — five to thirteen times too high — to be attributed to new information about future real dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to &quot;save&quot; the EMH is to attribute the volatility to time-varying expected real interest rates, but &quot;such a theory... relies fundamentally on unobservables and cannot be evaluated statistically.&quot;</p>
<h3>Data Construction (Appendix, pp. 434-436)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Set 1:</strong> S&amp;P Composite Stock Price index (continuation of Cowles Commission index), deflated by wholesale price index, 1871-1979. Dividend series from Standard and Poor's.</li>
<li><strong>Data Set 2:</strong> Modified Dow Jones Industrial Average, 30 stocks, 1928-1979. Shiller manually tracked stock splits, mergers, and replacements using <em>Capital Changes Reporter</em> to construct a consistent series. Deflated by same wholesale price index.</li>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Opening Salvo Against EMH</h3>
<p>Shiller (1981) was the most quantitatively dramatic early challenge to efficient markets. While Jensen et al. (1978) had documented some anomalies, Shiller showed that the ENTIRE price series was too volatile — not just specific subsets of stocks. This was an attack on the EMH's most basic prediction: that prices reflect fundamental value.</p>
<h3>2. Excess Volatility as a Research Program</h3>
<p>The paper launched the &quot;excess volatility&quot; literature — one of the three main empirical challenges to the EMH (along with cross-sectional anomalies like Fama-French 1992 and behavioral anomalies like De Bondt &amp; Thaler 1985). Researchers debated the variance bounds methodology for years (Marsh &amp; Merton 1986, Kleidon 1986, West 1988), but the basic finding survived.</p>
<h3>3. The Visual Power of Figures 1-2</h3>
<p>The smooth p* versus volatile p comparison became one of the most reproduced figures in financial economics. It communicates instantly what regression tables cannot: prices move far more than fundamentals justify. This visual argument influenced a generation of researchers.</p>
<h3>4. Time-Varying Discount Rates — The Escape Route</h3>
<p>The paper identified the key escape route for EMH defenders: time-varying expected returns (discount rates). This became the central debate in asset pricing — Campbell &amp; Shiller (1988) would later show that most variation in price-dividend ratios reflects varying expected returns, not varying expected dividends. But whether varying expected returns reflect rational risk pricing or irrational sentiment remains unresolved.</p>
<h3>5. Connection to Practitioners' Intuition</h3>
<p>Practitioners had always known that markets overshoot — booms and busts, bubbles and crashes. Shiller provided the first rigorous framework for quantifying this intuition. The gap between the smooth p* and the volatile p is the gap between &quot;fundamental value&quot; (what Graham &amp; Dodd called &quot;intrinsic value&quot;) and market price.</p>
