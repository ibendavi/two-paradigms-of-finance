    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang's 2014 <em>Review of Accounting Studies</em> paper shows that EPS-based compensation contracts cause managers to choose debt over equity when equity issuance would dilute EPS. The critical mechanism: equity issuance dilutes EPS when the firm's earnings yield (E/P) exceeds the after-tax cost of debt r_d(1-T_c) — the same accretion condition from the repurchase literature applied in reverse. Using S&amp;P 500 firms from 1998-2006, they find that 44.8% of firms use EPS as a bonus metric (the single most common metric). Their main result: the interaction EPS × EPSDILUTION = 0.329 (p = 0.02) in probit regressions of debt choice — firms with EPS-contingent bonuses are significantly more likely to choose debt when equity would be EPS-dilutive. This is robust in 2SLS and Wooldridge selection models. The bonus compensation magnitude also matters: BONUSCOMP × EPSDILUTION = 0.632 (p = 0.01), but only when the EPS bonus indicator equals one. EPS-aversion distorts capital structure: it accelerates adjustment toward target leverage when firms are underleveraged (NEGDEVIATION × EPSDILUTION = -0.805, p = 0.05) but impedes adjustment when firms are overleveraged. Using Graham's (2000) kink measure, EPS-contingent compensation significantly reduces debt conservatism — mean kink is 3.349 for EPS-dilution-averse firms vs. 4.300 for others. For the EPS project, this paper demonstrates that the EPS accretion/dilution condition directly shapes the debt-equity choice — the same condition that determines repurchase policy also determines financing policy, confirming that EPS maximization operates as a unified objective function for capital structure decisions.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 877-882)</h3>
<p><strong>The question:</strong> When managers need external capital, they choose between debt and equity. The NPV paradigm says this choice should depend on the trade-off between tax benefits and financial distress costs, or on information asymmetry (pecking order). Huang et al. propose an alternative: managers choose debt when equity issuance would dilute EPS, particularly when their compensation is tied to EPS.</p>
<p><strong>The EPS dilution condition (from the Appendix):</strong></p>
<p>Equity issuance dilutes EPS when:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E/P &gt; r_d(1 - T_c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where E/P is the earnings yield, r_d is the interest rate on debt, and T_c is the corporate tax rate. This is the MIRROR IMAGE of the repurchase accretion condition in Hribar et al. (2006) and Bens et al. (2003). When the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax cost of debt, adding new shares (equity) dilutes EPS while adding debt does not.</p>
<p><strong>Equivalently:</strong> managers prefer debt when the cost of equity (measured by the earnings yield) exceeds the after-tax cost of debt. This IS the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction: the firm levers up when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate.</p>
<p><strong>Three hypotheses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>H1 (Contracting):</strong> Managers with EPS-based compensation contracts are more likely to choose debt when equity would dilute EPS.</li>
<li><strong>H2 (Sentiment):</strong> During periods of low investor sentiment, the market is more EPS-focused, amplifying dilution aversion.</li>
<li><strong>H3 (Clientele):</strong> Firms with more transient (short-horizon) institutional investors face greater pressure on EPS, amplifying dilution aversion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 2: Data and Methodology (pp. 882-890)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> S&amp;P 500 firms, 1998-2006. Public debt and equity issuances from SDC Platinum. Compensation data hand-collected from proxy statements.</p>
<p><strong>Key variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EPS:</strong> Indicator = 1 if the firm's proxy statement mentions EPS as a bonus metric. Found in 44.8% of sample firms — the single MOST common bonus metric.</li>
<li><strong>EPSDILUTION:</strong> Indicator = 1 if equity issuance would dilute EPS, computed using the E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) condition.</li>
<li><strong>BONUSCOMP:</strong> Dollar value of bonus compensation relative to total compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Dependent variable:</strong> DEBT = 1 if the firm issues public debt; = 0 if it issues public equity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Firm size, leverage, profitability, market-to-book, asset tangibility, stock return, R&amp;D intensity, cash flow volatility, credit rating, investment grade dummy, tax rate, plus instruments for the EPS compensation decision.</p>
<p><strong>EPS as the dominant bonus metric (Table 1):</strong></p>

<p>EPS is the most commonly used single metric in executive bonus contracts, confirming the centrality of EPS in corporate compensation.</p>
<h3>Section 3: First-Stage Results (pp. 890-893)</h3>
<p><strong>Determinants of EPS-based compensation (Table 3):</strong></p>
<p>Firms are more likely to use EPS in bonus contracts when they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher analyst following (coefficient positive, significant)</li>
<li>More predictable earnings (lower volatility)</li>
<li>Higher institutional ownership</li>
<li>Larger firm size</li>
</ul>
<p>These are firms where EPS is more visible and more closely monitored — exactly the firms where the EPS paradigm predicts the strongest EPS management incentives.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Main Results — Debt-Equity Choice (pp. 893-903)</h3>

<p>The interaction is the key result: the debt preference exists ONLY when both conditions hold — the firm has EPS-based compensation AND equity issuance would dilute EPS. Neither condition alone is sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness:</strong> The result holds in:</p>
<ul>
<li>2SLS with first-stage instruments for the EPS compensation choice</li>
<li>Wooldridge selection model correcting for sample selection</li>
<li>Alternative specifications with year and industry fixed effects</li>
</ul>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The magnitude of bonus compensation matters — but ONLY for firms with EPS-contingent bonuses. For firms without EPS bonuses, larger bonuses do not amplify the dilution aversion. This confirms the mechanism is specifically tied to EPS metrics, not to general compensation sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Speed of adjustment to target leverage (Table 7):</strong></p>
<p>EPS dilution aversion affects how quickly firms adjust toward their target leverage ratio:</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>POSDEVIATION × EPSDILUTION</td>
<td>positive but insignificant</td>
<td>—</td>
<td>Overleveraged: EPS dilution may impede adjustment</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When firms are BELOW their target leverage (NEGDEVIATION), the EPS dilution aversion pushes them toward debt, which happens to align with moving toward the target — so EPS concerns HELP close the leverage gap. When firms are ABOVE target, EPS dilution aversion would push toward more debt (not equity), IMPEDING adjustment toward target — but this effect is not statistically significant.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Debt conservatism (Table 8) — Using Graham's (2000) kink measure:</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;kink&quot; measures how far a firm is from the point where the marginal tax benefit of debt equals zero. A kink &gt; 1 means the firm is below its tax-optimal debt level (debt conservative). A higher kink = more conservative.</p>

<td><strong>0.01</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>EPS × EPSDILUTION</strong></td>
<td><strong>-0.827</strong></td>
<td><strong>0.01</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All three are significantly negative — EPS-contingent compensation reduces debt conservatism. Firms with EPS bonuses that face EPS dilution from equity have LESS debt conservatism (lower kink), meaning they use MORE debt relative to the tax-optimal level.</p>
<p><strong>Mean kink values:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Group</th>
<th>Mean Kink</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>EPS = 1, EPSDILUTION = 1</td>
<td>3.349</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All others</td>
<td>4.300</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both groups have kink &gt; 1 (both are still somewhat debt-conservative), but the EPS-dilution-averse group is significantly less conservative — they use relatively more debt. However, the average kink of 3.3 suggests these firms are NOT overleveraged; they are simply less underleveraged. The EPS dilution motive reduces debt conservatism without causing outright overleveraging on average.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Sentiment and Clientele Tests (pp. 903-906)</h3>
<p><strong>H2 (Sentiment):</strong> The Baker-Wurgler sentiment index does NOT significantly amplify the EPS dilution effect. Low sentiment periods do not make EPS dilution aversion stronger. This null result suggests the mechanism is contracting-based (compensation), not market-sentiment-driven.</p>
<p><strong>H3 (Clientele):</strong> Transient institutional ownership does NOT significantly amplify the effect. The investor clientele channel is not supported. Again, the mechanism appears to be internal (compensation contracts) rather than external (investor pressure).</p>
<h3>Appendix: Derivation of the EPS Dilution Condition (pp. 910-912)</h3>
<p><strong>Formal derivation:</strong></p>
<p>Starting from EPS = E / N where E is earnings and N is shares:</p>
<p>After equity issuance of ΔN shares at price P, raising ΔN × P in capital deployed at return r_d:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EPS_new = (E + ΔN × P × r_d × (1 - T_c)) / (N + ΔN)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equity issuance dilutes EPS (EPS_new &lt; EPS_old) when:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E/P &gt; r_d(1 - T_c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the earnings yield exceeding the after-tax cost of debt. Equivalently, the &quot;cost of equity&quot; (earnings yield) exceeds the after-tax cost of debt.</p>
<p>For debt issuance of amount D at rate r_d:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EPS_new = (E + D × r_d × (1 - T_c) - D × r_d × (1 - T_c)) / N = E/N = EPS_old</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait — this isn't right for debt. For debt: EPS_new = (E - D × r_d × (1 - T_c) + D × r_d × (1 - T_c)) / N. The invested returns offset the interest cost. In practice, debt is EPS-neutral when invested at the borrowing rate, but EPS-accretive when the return on invested capital exceeds the after-tax interest rate.</p>
<p>The key insight: when E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c), equity is &quot;expensive&quot; in EPS terms — issuing shares dilutes EPS while adding debt does not. This is the EPS paradigm's cost-of-equity condition applied to the financing decision.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The EPS Accretion Condition Unifies Repurchases and Financing</h3>
<p>The same condition — E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) — determines both when repurchases are EPS-accretive (Hribar et al. 2006, Bens et al. 2003) and when equity issuance is EPS-dilutive (this paper). This unification is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts: capital structure decisions (leverage, payout, issuance) are all governed by a single condition comparing the earnings yield to the cost of alternative capital.</p>
<h3>2. EPS Is the #1 Bonus Metric</h3>
<p>The finding that 44.8% of S&amp;P 500 firms use EPS as a bonus metric — more than any other single metric — is direct evidence that EPS maximization is institutionalized in corporate governance. The EPS paradigm doesn't just claim managers care about EPS; it can point to the compensation contracts that formalize this objective.</p>
<h3>3. The Contracting Channel Confirms Institutional EPS Maximization</h3>
<p>The interaction result — EPS × EPSDILUTION significant, but neither alone — shows that the mechanism runs specifically through EPS-contingent compensation. This is NOT a behavioral bias (managers irrationally avoiding dilution). It is a rational response to contractual incentives that explicitly reward EPS performance. The EPS paradigm is embedded in corporate governance structures.</p>
<h3>4. EPS Aversion Distorts Capital Structure — In a Specific, Predictable Way</h3>
<p>The speed-of-adjustment results reveal how EPS concerns distort capital structure dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underleveraged firms:</strong> EPS dilution aversion pushes them toward debt, COINCIDENTALLY moving them toward optimal leverage faster</li>
<li><strong>Overleveraged firms:</strong> EPS dilution aversion resists equity issuance, potentially keeping them overleveraged longer</li>
</ul>
<p>This asymmetric effect is a specific prediction of the EPS paradigm: the EPS objective aligns with value maximization when the firm is underleveraged (both favor more debt) but conflicts when the firm is overleveraged (EPS favors more debt, value maximization favors equity).</p>
<h3>5. Reduced Debt Conservatism — Not Overleveraging</h3>
<p>The kink results show that EPS-motivated firms are less debt-conservative (kink 3.3 vs. 4.3), but the average kink is still well above 1 — they are NOT overleveraged relative to the tax-optimal point. This is important nuance: EPS maximization pushes firms toward MORE debt but does not (on average) push them past the tax-optimal point. The EPS paradigm and the trade-off theory give directionally similar predictions for the average firm.</p>
<h3>6. Sentiment and Clientele Channels Are Not Supported</h3>
<p>The null results on sentiment (H2) and institutional clientele (H3) are informative: EPS dilution aversion is driven by INTERNAL compensation contracts, not by external market conditions or investor pressure. This supports the EPS paradigm's view that EPS maximization is a management objective function, not a response to market pressure.</p>
<h3>7. The Appendix Derives the EPS Paradigm's Cost of Equity</h3>
<p>The Appendix's derivation of the EPS dilution condition — E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) — is essentially a derivation of the EPS paradigm's cost of equity. The earnings yield E/P is the cost of equity; when it exceeds the after-tax cost of debt, the firm should prefer debt. This is the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction, derived here from the perspective of EPS dilution avoidance.</p>

<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> — &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show that EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out real investment.

<li><strong>Andrade (1997)</strong> — &quot;Do Appearances Matter?&quot; Shows EPS accretion affects acquirer stock prices in M&amp;A. Huang et al. extend to show EPS dilution aversion affects issuance decisions — the EPS motive operates across all capital allocation decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Huang et al. provide perhaps the cleanest evidence for the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction. The condition E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) is exactly the EPS paradigm's condition for when equity is &quot;expensive&quot; relative to debt. The interaction result (EPS × EPSDILUTION) shows this condition directly drives the debt-equity choice, mediated by compensation contracts that formalize EPS maximization.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — If EPS dilution aversion causes firms to prefer debt over equity even when equity would be more appropriate (e.g., for risky R&amp;D projects), the distortion extends to investment policy. Overleveraged firms unable to issue equity due to EPS concerns may underinvest.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The condition E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) depends on interest rates. When rates fall, the after-tax cost of debt r_d(1-T_c) falls, making the condition MORE likely to hold — more firms find that equity would be EPS-dilutive — pushing aggregate capital structure toward more debt. This connects EPS dilution aversion to the secular leverage increase documented in the Meli paper.</li>
