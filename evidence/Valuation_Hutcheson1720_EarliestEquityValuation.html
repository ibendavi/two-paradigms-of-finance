    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Archibald Hutcheson's 1720 pamphlets contain the earliest known systematic equity valuation exercises, computing &quot;intrinsick value&quot; of South Sea Company stock. His method is earnings capitalization: take the Company's annuity income, capitalize it at a market rate (V = income/r), subtract liabilities, divide by shares outstanding. The numbers make this clear — £200 at 5%, £250 at 4%, £333 at 3% — these are capitalized income figures. He then compares this &quot;intrinsick value&quot; to the market price (£1,000+) and shows the stock is 3-5x overvalued. This is the multiples/capitalization approach, applied to equity, two centuries before Graham &amp; Dodd.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Valuation Method: Earnings Capitalization</h3>
<p>Hutcheson capitalizes the Company's income stream at a required rate of return and divides by shares outstanding. The Company's main &quot;asset&quot; is a stream of government annuity payments — but valuing that stream at income/r IS earnings capitalization. The fact that he frames it as &quot;valuing assets&quot; does not change what the math is: V = E/r.</p>
<p>The accounting wrapper (assets minus liabilities, divided by shares) is just the vehicle. The valuation step — the step where a number gets turned into a price — is capitalization of income at a market rate.</p>
<h3>The Core Calculation</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Income:</strong> Annual annuity payments received by the Company from the government</li>
<li><strong>Capitalization:</strong> Income ÷ required rate (at 5%, 4%, 3% — showing sensitivity)</li>
<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Subtract liabilities, account for trading income (rough estimate)</li>
<li><strong>Value per share:</strong> Net value ÷ shares outstanding (adjusting for new issuances)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Numerical Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 1: Capitalized value at varying rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At 5%: intrinsic value = ~£200 per £100 stock (= income / 0.05)</li>
<li>At 4%: intrinsic value = ~£250 per £100 stock (= income / 0.04)</li>
<li>At 3%: intrinsic value = ~£333 per £100 stock (= income / 0.03)</li>
<li>Market price at peak: £1,000+ per £100 stock</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers ARE the capitalization formula. £200 at 5% means the income per £100 of stock is £10, capitalized at 5%. £333 at 3% = £10 / 0.03. The rate sensitivity analysis is exactly what a modern analyst does when showing value at different cap rates.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2: Impact of the National Debt Conversion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the Company successfully converts £31M of national debt into equity</li>
<li>Capitalizes the resulting annuity income at different assumed rates</li>
<li>Shows that even under the most optimistic assumptions, the stock is wildly overvalued</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise 3: Dilution Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculates how each new share issuance dilutes existing shareholders</li>
<li>Tracks the &quot;money subscription&quot; scheme where new shares were sold at progressively higher prices</li>
<li>Shows that the Company was selling shares at 3-5x intrinsic value, enriching insiders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise 4: Dividend Sustainability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the Company's actual income (from annuities + trading profits)</li>
<li>Calculates maximum sustainable dividend per share</li>
<li>Shows the promised dividends were mathematically impossible to sustain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise 5: Present Value of Terminable Annuities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed tables computing PV of terminable government annuities at 4%, 5%, 6%</li>
<li>Distinguishes between perpetual annuities (where PV = income/r exactly) and terminable annuities (where PV requires a finite-horizon calculation)</li>
<li>The finite-horizon PV math comes from bond/annuity valuation (known since de Witt 1671) — Hutcheson applies it correctly</li>
</ul>
<h3>The &quot;Intrinsick Value&quot; Concept</h3>
<p>Hutcheson uses &quot;intrinsick value&quot; to mean: what the stock is worth based on the Company's income, capitalized at a reasonable rate. He compares this to the market price and shows they have diverged enormously. This is the same concept as Graham &amp; Dodd's &quot;intrinsic value&quot; — a fundamental value derived from earnings and a capitalization rate, compared to market price to identify over/undervaluation.</p>
<h3>Sophistication Level</h3>
<ul>
<li>Earnings capitalization (V = income/r): <strong>Yes</strong> — this IS what the numbers show</li>
<li>Discount rate sensitivity: <strong>Yes</strong> (shows values at 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%)</li>
<li>Dilution from new issuances: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Sustainability of dividends: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Finite-horizon PV for terminable annuities: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Trading/operating income projection: <strong>Basic</strong> (rough estimate of trade profits)</li>
<li>Risk adjustment: <strong>No</strong> — uses risk-free government rates as cap rates</li>
<li>Market efficiency concept: <strong>Implicit</strong> — argues market is wrong, intrinsic value differs from price</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <ol>
<li><strong>Earliest known systematic equity valuation</strong>: Predates all other known formal equity valuation exercises. Uses earnings capitalization — the same approach that would dominate practitioner valuation for the next 300 years.</li>
<li><strong>Practitioner, not academic</strong>: Real-time financial analysis by a Member of Parliament trying to warn investors — pure practitioner stream.</li>
<li><strong>The multiples/capitalization approach is ancient</strong>: Hutcheson's method — capitalize income at a market rate, compare to price — is exactly what practitioners still do today (P = EPS x P/E, or equivalently, V = E / cap rate). The method long predates its formalization in textbooks.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Intrinsick value&quot; vs. market price</strong>: The earliest known use of fundamental valuation to identify a bubble. Hutcheson shows the stock is 3-5x overvalued by any reasonable capitalization rate.</li>
<li><strong>The finite-horizon PV is a refinement, not the core method</strong>: For terminable annuities, Hutcheson correctly uses finite-horizon present value (bond math from de Witt 1671). But the conceptual framework is still capitalization: what is this income stream worth at a given rate? The PV calculation is a tool within the capitalization framework, not a separate &quot;DCF&quot; approach to equity.</li>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Same method as:</strong> Graham &amp; Dodd (1934), Gerstenberg (1924), Dewing (1920) — all use earnings capitalization (V = E/r) as the primary equity valuation approach. Hutcheson does it 200+ years earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Distinct from:</strong> Williams (1938) dividend discount model — Williams projects future dividends and discounts them back; Hutcheson capitalizes current income. Same formula in the perpetuity case, but different thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Contemporary with:</strong> Anonymous, <em>An Impartial Enquiry into the Value of South Sea Stock</em> (1720) — we also have this</li>
<li><strong>Contemporary with:</strong> <em>Het Groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid</em> (1720) — Dutch satire collection</li>
<li><strong>Built on:</strong> de Witt (1671) present value of annuities, Halley (1693) compound interest tables</li>
<li><strong>Relates to:</strong> Fairman (1795) systematic yield comparisons — extends the capitalization/yield approach to comparing ALL London securities</li>
<li><strong>Key scholarly sources:</strong> Goetzmann (2004) discusses Fibonacci's PV; Rubinstein (2006) covers the intellectual lineage; Poitras (2000) covers early financial economics</li>
