    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Ou &amp; Penman's 1989 <em>Journal of Accounting Research</em> paper investigates the information content of P/E ratios and financial statements for predicting future earnings and stock returns. The paper develops &quot;Pr,&quot; a logit-based probability measure constructed from 68 financial statement variables that predicts the direction of one-year-ahead earnings changes. The key finding: P/E ratios and financial statement information capture overlapping but distinct information about future earnings. The P/E ratio identifies transitory components of current earnings (the &quot;Molodovsky effect&quot; — high P/E signals temporarily depressed earnings), while Pr captures future earnings information in financial statements. Both predict future stock returns, but their return predictions are negatively correlated — the P/E effect and the Pr effect reflect different aspects of market (in)efficiency. Critically for the EPS project, footnote 1 states: &quot;The ratio has traditionally been interpreted as an earnings capitalization multiplier&quot; — confirming that earnings capitalization is the traditional framework for understanding P/E ratios.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Framework: P/E as Earnings Capitalization (pp. 111-114)</h3>
<p>The paper's opening framework treats the P/E ratio as an earnings capitalization multiplier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ratio has traditionally been interpreted as an earnings capitalization multiplier.&quot; (fn. 1, p. 111)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The P/E ratio is decomposed into information components:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P/E = f(information about future earnings in current earnings, information about future earnings not in current earnings)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If P/E only reflected the capitalization rate, all firms would have the same P/E. Cross-sectional variation in P/E arises because current earnings contain transitory components and because the market has information about future earnings beyond current earnings.</p>
<h3>The Pr Measure: Predicting Earnings from Financial Statements (pp. 114-118)</h3>
<p>Ou &amp; Penman construct the Pr measure using a two-stage process:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 (Univariate selection):</strong> 68 accounting descriptors (ratios, changes, levels) are tested individually for their ability to predict the sign of one-year-ahead earnings changes. Descriptors include current ratio, quick ratio, inventory turnover, return on equity, debt-equity ratio, gross margin, sales/total assets, cash flow/total debt, and many others (Tables 8-9 in the Appendix list all 68).</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 (Multivariate logit):</strong> Selected descriptors are combined in a logit model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pr(ΔEPS_{t+1} &gt; 0) = 1/(1 + e^{-y})</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where y is a linear combination of the selected accounting variables. The model is estimated in two periods: 1965-72 and 1973-77, then tested out of sample.</p>
<p><strong>Model performance (Table 9):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1965-72: 11,322 obs, likelihood ratio 908.43, concordant pairs 69.9%, Spearman rank correlation .42</li>
<li>1973-77: 11,776 obs, likelihood ratio 855.97, concordant pairs 65.4%, Spearman rank correlation .33</li>
</ul>
<h3>P/E Identifies Transitory Earnings: The Molodovsky Effect (pp. 118-121)</h3>
<p>The paper's central empirical finding about P/E ratios concerns the &quot;Molodovsky effect&quot; (named after Nicholas Molodovsky's 1953 article &quot;A Theory of Price-Earnings Ratios&quot;):</p>
<p>P/E ratios are MEAN-REVERTING: firms with high P/E tend to have subsequently rising earnings, and firms with low P/E tend to have subsequently falling earnings. This occurs because the P/E ratio captures transitory components of current earnings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High P/E</strong> = current earnings temporarily depressed (market prices through the trough)</li>
<li><strong>Low P/E</strong> = current earnings temporarily elevated (market prices through the peak)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cross-Sectional Regressions: E/P on Pr (Table 3, pp. 119-121)</h3>
<p>The key regression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(E/P)_it = α + βPr_it + ν_it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Results (mean across 11 years):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean β = -0.44 (t = 8.02)</li>
<li>Mean R² = 0.14 (from two-stage regression)</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative coefficient means: high Pr (predicting earnings increase) is associated with LOW E/P (high P/E). This is consistent with the Molodovsky effect — firms with high Pr have temporarily depressed current earnings (hence low E/P), and the financial statements signal the earnings will recover.</p>
<p><strong>Rank correlations (Table 2):</strong> The Spearman rank correlation between Pr and E/P is -.22 (mean across years), confirming the negative association.</p>
<h3>Pr and P/E Predict Future Earnings Differently (Tables 4-5, pp. 121-126)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 4:</strong> Portfolios sorted by Pr show monotonically increasing one-year-ahead earnings changes. Mean ΔEPS_{t+1}/EPS_t ranges from -25.3% (lowest Pr decile) to +92.5% (highest Pr decile).</p>
<p><strong>Table 5:</strong> Returns for Pr portfolios show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market-adjusted returns over FYE-9 to FYE+3: high Pr associated with LOW returns (reflecting the transitory earnings effect — prices have already moved)</li>
<li>Cumulative returns FYE+3 to FYE+27: Pr predicts POSITIVE future returns (hedge portfolio return of 12.56% over 24 months)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pr measure correctly predicted the sign of one-year-ahead earnings changes 57.8% of the time overall. For extreme Pr values (Pr &gt; .8 or Pr ≤ .2), the prediction success rate was only 43.8%, but for middle values (.4 &lt; Pr ≤ .6), it was 57.8%.</p>
<h3>P/E Also Predicts Future Returns: The P/E Effect (Table 6, pp. 129-131)</h3>
<p>Nine portfolios sorted by E/P (plus a separate portfolio for negative E/P firms) show:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current earnings changes:</strong> Monotonically decreasing from portfolio 1 (low E/P, high P/E) at +16.6% to portfolio 9 (high E/P, low P/E) at -13.7%</li>
<li><strong>One-year-ahead earnings changes:</strong> Monotonically INCREASING from -25.3% to +34.4% — confirming the Molodovsky effect (mean reversion of earnings)</li>
<li><strong>Market-adjusted returns FYE-9 to FYE+3:</strong> High E/P associated with HIGH prior returns; low E/P with LOW prior returns</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative returns FYE+3 to FYE+27:</strong> E/P hedge portfolio yields significant returns (the &quot;P/E effect&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>P/E and Pr Provide Different Information (Table 7, pp. 131-135)</h3>
<p>The most analytically important table cross-sorts firms on both E/P (7 portfolios) and Pr (5 groups plus extreme tails). Key findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>E/P and Pr are negatively correlated</strong> (mean Spearman rank correlation ranges from -.15 to +.01 across E/P portfolios, mostly negative).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Pr strategy and E/P strategy capture different phenomena:</strong> For a given E/P level, Pr still discriminates future returns. For a given Pr level, E/P still discriminates future returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The returns to E/P and Pr strategies are negatively correlated:</strong> The E/P effect captures underreaction to current earnings information, while the Pr effect captures underreaction to financial statement information about FUTURE earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E/P captures information about future earnings not in Pr:</strong> The P/E ratio reflects the market's assessment of both transitory current earnings AND future earnings information that goes beyond what financial statements capture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Two-Stage Regression: Pr as Instrument for Earnings Changes (p. 127)</h3>
<p>A two-stage regression uses Pr to instrument for earnings changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stage 1: CU_{it}^{12} = γ₀ + γ₁ ΔEPS_{it}/EPS_{it-1} + w_{it}
Stage 2: ΔEPS_{it+1}/EPS_{it} = γ'₀ + γ'₁w_{it} + λ_{it+1}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mean γ̂₁ over 11 years: 0.23 (t = 8.02); mean R² for second stage: 0.04. These values are similar to those observed by Beaver, Lambert, and Ryan (1987).</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Financial Statements as Forward-Looking (pp. 135-136)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The evidence presented in this paper demonstrates that accounting statements provide more than a historical perspective on the firm. Financial statements, like prices, are also prospective.&quot; (p. 135)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Although there is adequate evidence here and elsewhere that prices lead earnings, we find that price changes predict earnings changes relatively poorly when accounting statements indicate a high transitory component to current earnings.&quot; (p. 136)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rather than supporting the view that accounting rules garble information about earnings and that prices contain information that provides a correction to the accounting calculation, our evidence indicates that accounting reports contain information that filters out transitory components.&quot; (p. 136)</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. P/E as &quot;Earnings Capitalization Multiplier&quot; — The Traditional View</h3>
<p>Footnote 1's statement that &quot;the ratio has traditionally been interpreted as an earnings capitalization multiplier&quot; directly confirms the EPS paradigm's framework: P = EPS × P/E. Ou &amp; Penman take this as the starting point for their analysis, treating P/E variation as reflecting differences in the capitalization of earnings across firms.</p>
<h3>2. The Molodovsky Effect Validates Earnings-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>The finding that P/E ratios are mean-reverting — high P/E firms have rising earnings, low P/E firms have falling earnings — is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts. The market prices through transitory earnings, applying a higher multiple when earnings are temporarily depressed and a lower multiple when they are temporarily elevated. This is earnings-based pricing with a correction for earnings quality.</p>
<h3>3. Financial Statements Contain Forward-Looking Earnings Information</h3>
<p>The Pr measure's ability to predict future earnings from current financial statement data supports the EPS paradigm's view that accounting numbers are informative for valuation. Financial statements are not mere backward-looking records — they contain projections of future earning power, which is exactly what the earnings capitalization approach requires.</p>
<h3>4. The P/E Effect as Evidence of Earnings-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>The documented &quot;P/E effect&quot; (high E/P firms earn higher subsequent returns) can be interpreted in the EPS paradigm as follows: the earnings yield (E/P) IS the expected return on equity. High E/P firms have high expected returns because the market prices them at a high capitalization rate. This is not an &quot;anomaly&quot; — it is the natural consequence of earnings-based pricing.</p>
<h3>5. E/P and Pr Capture Different Information — Both Earnings-Based</h3>
<p>Both the P/E ratio and the Pr measure are fundamentally about earnings: P/E capitalizes current earnings with a forward-looking multiplier, while Pr extracts future earnings information from financial statements. The fact that both predict returns (from different angles) reinforces the centrality of earnings to asset pricing.</p>
<h3>6. The Negative Correlation Between E/P and Pr Effects</h3>
<p>The finding that returns to E/P and Pr strategies are negatively correlated suggests that the market processes different types of earnings information at different speeds. Current earnings flow into prices more quickly (via P/E), while financial statement details about future earnings (via Pr) are incorporated more slowly. Both channels, however, are fundamentally about earnings.</p>
