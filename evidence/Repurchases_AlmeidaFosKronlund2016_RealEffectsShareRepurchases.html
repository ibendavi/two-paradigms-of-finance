    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund's 2016 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper uses a regression discontinuity design to show that EPS-motivated share repurchases crowd out real investment. The key innovation is identifying EPS-motivated repurchases as those occurring precisely at the threshold where firms would otherwise just miss the analyst consensus EPS. Figure 1 shows a sharp discontinuity: the probability of an accretive repurchase jumps from less than 1.5% to approximately 3.5% at zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise — firms that would just miss consensus are dramatically more likely to repurchase. Fully 37% of all repurchased dollars are spent by firms in the narrow band just below zero. These EPS-motivated repurchases have real consequences: over the next four quarters, they reduce employment by ~5% of average, capital expenditure by ~10% of mean, and R&amp;D by ~3% of mean. Instrumental variable estimates confirm causality (IV coefficient on employment = -222.2, t = -6.90). Cross-sectional tests show the discontinuity is stronger for firms mentioning &quot;EPS&quot; in their proxy statements and for financially unconstrained firms; constrained firms show no discontinuity. The market rewards firms that change their EPS surprise sign from negative to positive via repurchases with the same positive CAR as natural beaters, but firms that cut real variables to finance repurchases earn 0.21-0.65% lower announcement CARs and show worse subsequent ROA. For the EPS project, this is the strongest causal evidence that EPS management through repurchases has real costs — confirming the EPS paradigm's prediction that the objective to maximize EPS can distort investment decisions.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 168-172)</h3>
<p><strong>The question:</strong> Do share repurchases crowd out real investment? This is contentious: traditional finance says firms repurchase when investment opportunities are poor (no crowding out), while critics argue that EPS-focused repurchases divert resources from productive uses.</p>
<p><strong>The identification problem:</strong> Firms that repurchase may simply have fewer investment opportunities. The paper resolves this with a regression discontinuity (RD) design around zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise — the point where the EPS management motive creates a discontinuous jump in repurchase probability.</p>
<p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Around the zero threshold, firms with pre-repurchase EPS just below consensus (e.g., -1 cent) are dramatically more likely to repurchase than firms just above (+1 cent). This discontinuity is driven by EPS management, not by investment opportunities, providing a clean instrument for EPS-motivated repurchases.</p>
<h3>Section 2: Data and Identification (pp. 172-176)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> All Compustat/CRSP/I/B/E/S firms, 1988-2010. Quarterly observations. Repurchases identified from Compustat cash flow statement.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-repurchase EPS surprise:</strong> Computed as the EPS the firm WOULD have reported without the repurchase minus the consensus forecast. The repurchase mechanically changes diluted EPS by reducing the share count.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1 — The central identification plot:</strong></p>
<p>The probability of an accretive repurchase as a function of pre-repurchase EPS surprise shows a sharp, visible discontinuity at zero:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms with pre-repurchase surprise just below zero: ~3.5% probability of accretive repurchase</li>
<li>Firms with pre-repurchase surprise just above zero: ~1.5% probability</li>
<li>The jump is abrupt and concentrated within ±2 cents of zero</li>
</ul>
<p>This discontinuity is the paper's identification: the EPS management motive creates an exogenous jump in repurchase behavior right at zero.</p>
<p><strong>37% statistic:</strong> 37% of all dollars spent on repurchases are by firms in the narrow band of pre-repurchase EPS surprises just below zero. This means that over a third of aggregate repurchase activity may be driven by the desire to meet or beat the penny-level analyst consensus.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Real Effects (pp. 176-180)</h3>
<p><strong>Main results — What happens to investment after EPS-motivated repurchases (Tables 3-5):</strong></p>
<p>Over the next four quarters, firms that repurchase to meet EPS targets reduce:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Reduction</th>
<th>Relative to mean</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Employment</td>
<td>-99.5 employees</td>
<td>~5% of sample mean</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capital expenditure</td>
<td>-$5.4 million</td>
<td>~10% of sample mean</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R&amp;D spending</td>
<td>-$1.2 million</td>
<td>~3% of sample mean</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Instrumental variable estimates (Table 5):</strong></p>
<p>Using the RD threshold as an instrument for EPS-motivated repurchases:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>IV coefficient</th>
<th>t-stat</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Employment</td>
<td><strong>-222.2</strong></td>
<td><strong>-6.90</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capital expenditure</td>
<td>-16.7</td>
<td>-2.84</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R&amp;D</td>
<td>-6.4</td>
<td>-2.03</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The IV estimates are larger than OLS, suggesting OLS underestimates the true crowding-out effect (likely because firms with good investment opportunities are also more likely to repurchase, biasing OLS toward zero).</p>
<h3>Section 4: Cross-Sectional Tests (pp. 180-183)</h3>
<p><strong>4.1 Firms mentioning &quot;EPS&quot; in proxy statements (Figure 3):</strong></p>
<p>The RD discontinuity is significantly STRONGER for firms whose proxy statements mention &quot;EPS&quot; — direct evidence that the mechanism is EPS management. Firms that explicitly tie compensation or targets to EPS are more aggressive in using repurchases to hit the number.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Financial constraints (Figure 4):</strong></p>
<p>The discontinuity exists only for financially UNCONSTRAINED firms. Constrained firms show NO discontinuity — they cannot afford to repurchase shares just to manage EPS. This is important: it rules out the alternative that the discontinuity is driven by firms in financial distress or with liquidity problems.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Market reaction (Table 10):</strong></p>
<p>Firms that change their EPS surprise sign from negative to positive via repurchases (i.e., would have missed but the repurchase converted it to a beat) earn the SAME positive announcement CAR as firms that naturally beat consensus. At the announcement level, the market does not distinguish between organic beats and repurchase-manufactured beats.</p>
<p>However, firms that cut real variables (employment, capex, R&amp;D) to finance repurchases earn 0.21-0.65% LOWER announcement CARs. The market partially penalizes firms that sacrifice real investment for EPS management.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Long-Run Consequences (pp. 183-184)</h3>
<p><strong>Subsequent operating performance (Table 12):</strong></p>
<p>Firms that cut R&amp;D and employment to finance EPS-motivated repurchases show WORSE subsequent ROA performance. The real investment cuts have real performance consequences — this is not free EPS.</p>
<p>However, the capital expenditure cuts appear somewhat short-lived — capex tends to recover more quickly than employment or R&amp;D. This suggests some of the capex reduction may involve timing (delaying projects by a quarter or two) rather than permanent cancellation.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Conclusion (p. 184-185)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our findings suggest that a significant fraction of repurchases are driven by the desire to meet or just beat analyst EPS forecasts and that these repurchases come at the expense of real investment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors emphasize that the regression discontinuity design provides causal evidence — not merely correlation — that EPS management drives both repurchase decisions and their real consequences.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Causal Evidence That EPS Maximization Distorts Investment</h3>
<p>This is the strongest paper showing that the EPS objective function has REAL COSTS. In the NPV paradigm, managers would never sacrifice positive-NPV projects for EPS. In the EPS paradigm, they do — and Almeida et al. provide causal evidence via the RD design. The ~5% employment reduction, ~10% capex reduction, and ~3% R&amp;D reduction are economically meaningful consequences of EPS maximization.</p>
<h3>2. The 37% Statistic Is Stunning</h3>
<p>Over a third of all repurchased dollars are spent by firms trying to flip their EPS surprise from negative to positive. This means that aggregate repurchase activity — a multi-hundred-billion-dollar phenomenon — is significantly driven by penny-level EPS management. This is not a marginal phenomenon; it is a first-order driver of corporate payout policy.</p>
<h3>3. The RD Design Identifies EPS Management Cleanly</h3>
<p>The sharp discontinuity at zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise is the cleanest identification of EPS-motivated corporate behavior in the literature. It cannot be explained by investment opportunities (which don't jump at zero), by tax considerations (which are continuous), or by other repurchase motives. The jump exists solely because of the EPS threshold.</p>
<h3>4. &quot;EPS&quot; in Proxy Statements Strengthens the Discontinuity</h3>
<p>The cross-sectional test using proxy statement language is elegant: firms that EXPLICITLY mention EPS as a performance target show a stronger discontinuity. This confirms the mechanism is EPS management, not an artifact.</p>
<h3>5. Unconstrained Firms Drive the Effect — Consistent with EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>The finding that ONLY unconstrained firms show the discontinuity is important. In the EPS paradigm, EPS management is a luxury of firms with financial slack — they have the cash to deploy on repurchases. Constrained firms face binding capital constraints that prevent EPS management via repurchases. This is consistent with the EPS paradigm's prediction that repurchases are used by cash-rich firms (where the earnings yield exceeds the return on cash).</p>
<h3>6. Market Rewards the EPS Beat — Even When Manufactured</h3>
<p>The finding that firms flipping their surprise sign via repurchases earn the SAME announcement CAR as natural beaters is powerful evidence for P = EPS × P/E. At the announcement, the market capitalizes reported EPS without distinguishing the source. This is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts: the market prices earnings, period.</p>
<h3>7. But the Market Partially Penalizes Real Cuts</h3>
<p>The 0.21-0.65% lower CAR for firms cutting real variables and the worse subsequent ROA suggest the market is not completely fooled — it partially punishes the trade-off of real investment for cosmetic EPS. This is consistent with Hribar et al.'s (2006) finding of discounted ERCs on repurchase-induced EPS.</p>
<h3>8. Connects EPS Maximization to the Capital Budgeting Paper</h3>
<p>The finding that EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out capex, R&amp;D, and employment is direct evidence for the &quot;EPS and Capital Budgeting&quot; paper's thesis: when the objective is to maximize EPS, projects that are NPV-positive but EPS-dilutive may be foregone in favor of repurchases that are NPV-negative but EPS-accretive. The IV estimates provide the causal link.</p>
<h3>9. The Employment Effect Extends Beyond Finance</h3>
<p>A ~5% reduction in employment due to EPS-motivated repurchases connects the EPS paradigm to the broader debate about &quot;short-termism&quot; and shareholder capitalism. The EPS paradigm doesn't take sides on whether this is good or bad — it simply predicts that EPS maximization will lead to exactly this trade-off: fewer employees, less R&amp;D, less capex, but higher reported EPS.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — The IV estimates showing that EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out capex and R&amp;D are direct evidence for the capital budgeting paper: managers forego positive-NPV projects (R&amp;D, hiring, capex) to finance EPS-boosting repurchases.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The finding that 37% of repurchase dollars are EPS-motivated explains WHY firms prefer repurchases over dividends: repurchases can be surgically deployed quarter-by-quarter to manage EPS, while dividends cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The macro implications: if 37% of aggregate repurchase activity is EPS-motivated, and falling interest rates make repurchases more EPS-accretive (lower after-tax cost of alternative capital r), then the secular decline in rates amplifies EPS-motivated repurchases, contributing to the buyback boom documented in the Meli paper.</li>
