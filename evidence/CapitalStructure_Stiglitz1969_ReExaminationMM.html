    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Stiglitz's 1969 AER paper, a revised version of Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 242, proves that the Modigliani-Miller theorem holds under far more general conditions than originally assumed. Specifically, MM does NOT depend on (1) the existence of risk classes, (2) the competitiveness of the capital market, (3) agreement among individuals about probability distributions, or (4) partial equilibrium analysis. Using a general equilibrium state-preference model, Stiglitz shows that only TWO assumptions are essential: (a) individuals can borrow at the same rate as firms, and (b) there is no bankruptcy. Under these conditions, firm value is invariant to the debt-equity ratio. The paper also examines what happens when these assumptions are relaxed: with bankruptcy, MM can still hold if individuals can use securities as collateral and forfeit them in default. Most importantly for the EPS project, Stiglitz's footnote 15 states that &quot;there is no reason that firms necessarily will maximize market value&quot; — an observation that opens the door to alternative objective functions like EPS maximization.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Five Limitations of the Original MM Proof (p. 784)</h3>
<p>Stiglitz identifies five specific limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It depended on the existence of risk classes.</li>
<li>The use of risk classes seemed to imply objective rather than subjective probability distributions over possible outcomes.</li>
<li>It was based on partial equilibrium rather than general equilibrium analysis.</li>
<li>It was not clear whether the theorem held only for competitive markets.</li>
<li>Except under special circumstances, it was not clear how the possibility of firm bankruptcy affected the validity of the theorem.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section I: The Basic Theorem — General Equilibrium Proof (pp. 784-787)</h3>
<p>Stiglitz considers firms with gross returns X that depend on the state of the world θ. One dollar in bonds yields the safe return r*. Earnings per dollar invested in equity in state θ depend on whether there is bankruptcy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ε(θ) = [X(θ) - r<em>B]/E if r</em>B ≤ X(θ); = 0 if r*B ≥ X(θ) (equation 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where V = E + B (firm value = equity + bonds).</p>
<p><strong>The proof:</strong> Assume no bankruptcy and individuals can borrow and lend at the market rate r*. If a general equilibrium exists with each firm having a particular debt-equity ratio and a particular value, then there exists ANOTHER general equilibrium with any firm having any other debt-equity ratio but with the value of all firms and the market rate of interest unchanged.</p>
<p>The key mechanism: when a firm changes its debt-equity ratio, each individual can adjust their personal borrowing to exactly replicate their original income pattern. If individual j owns share α^j_i of firm i's equity and B^j bonds, and firm 1 issues no bonds, the individual can borrow B₁/E₁ per dollar of equity to replicate the leveraged position:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B̃^j = B^j + E^j₁(B₁/E₁) (equation on p. 786)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The individual's income in state θ is then identical to the original situation (equation 8 = equation 6'). Since opportunity sets are unchanged, the same allocation maximizes utility, and markets clear.</p>
<p><strong>Critical insight (p. 786):</strong> &quot;It should be emphasized that in this proof, X(θ) is subjectively determined; moreover no assumptions about the size of firms, the source of the uncertainty, and the existence of risk classes have been made.&quot;</p>
<p>The two crucial assumptions are: &quot;(a) all individuals agree that for all firms X_i(θ) &gt; r*B for all θ... and (b) individuals can borrow and lend at the market rate of interest. This assumption is considerably weaker than the assumption of a competitive capital market.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section II: Limitations on Individual Borrowing (pp. 787-788)</h3>
<p>Even if individuals cannot borrow directly, MM may still hold if they can adjust their bond holdings. The result &quot;does not require that individuals actually borrow from the market, but only that they change their holdings of bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>A problem arises only if an individual has NO bonds in his portfolio. If all individuals hold B^j ≥ 0 for all j, and firms' B_i satisfy certain inequalities (equation 9), all individuals will be lenders, and the theorem holds regardless of borrowing constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Key result on risk classes (p. 787-788):</strong> Even with bankruptcy risk, if there are multiple firms in the same risk class with the same pattern of returns, firms with the highest and lowest debt-equity ratios must have the same value — and therefore ALL other firms must have the same value. This &quot;rules out the possibility of a U-shaped curve relating the value of the firm to the debt-equity ratio.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section III: Bankruptcy (pp. 788-789)</h3>
<p>Bankruptcy creates two problems for MM: (1) the nominal rate of interest rises as the number of bonds increases, and (2) if a firm goes bankrupt, individuals cannot replicate the exact patterns of returns.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution with collateral:</strong> If an individual can borrow using securities as collateral and forfeit the security if returns fall below borrowing costs, then the pattern of returns on the bonds in bankruptcy will be the same for the individual as for the firm. In this case, MM still holds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;if a firm has a positive probability of going bankrupt, and an individual can borrow using those securities as collateral (so that if his return from the securities is less than his borrowings, he can forfeit the securities) the value of the firm is invariant to the debt-equity ratio.&quot; (p. 788)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The required margin is only B̃/V (not 100%). But in practice, individuals may not be able to make such arrangements, making bankruptcy a genuine challenge to MM.</p>
<h3>Mean-Variance Analysis and the Separation Theorem (pp. 789-790)</h3>
<p>Under mean-variance preferences, with only the first firm potentially going bankrupt, and all individuals agreeing on probability distributions, Stiglitz derives the valuation formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V = ρEX when market prices of dollar risk are proportional (p. 789)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E_i + B_i = {X̄ - k Σ_j ε(X_i - X̄_i)(X_j - X̄_j)} / r* (equation 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where k = r*(Σ_i(X_i - X̄_i)(X_j - X̄_j))/(Σ_i Σ_j ε(X_i - X̄_i)(X_j - X̄_j)), showing firm value depends on expected returns and covariances but NOT on the debt-equity ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Crucial observation (p. 789):</strong> Different firms may have different debt-equity ratios and the same value. &quot;The observation that all firms in a given risk class have the same value but possibly different debt-equity ratios can be taken as evidence that firms are value maximizers and are in market equilibrium. It is not necessarily evidence that the arbitrage activities described by Modigliani and Miller have occurred.&quot;</p>
<h3>Arrow-Debreu Securities (pp. 790-791)</h3>
<p>If there are enough securities to span all states of nature (i.e., the market is complete), then V = E + B is independent of the debt-equity ratio. This holds because each security can be decomposed into Arrow-Debreu state-contingent claims, and the value of the firm is simply the sum of state prices times state-contingent payoffs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V = E + B = Σ_θ X(θ)p*(θ) (p. 791)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three important observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals do NOT need to agree on the probability of different states of nature.</li>
<li>If there are fewer firms than states of nature, firm value IS generally a function of the debt-equity ratio.</li>
<li>In practice, business cycle states may approximate a small number of distinct states, making the economy look &quot;very much as if it were described by an Arrow-Debreu securities market.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Footnote 15: Firms Need Not Maximize Market Value (p. 791)</h3>
<p>This is the most important passage for the EPS project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It should be observed that when the actions of a firm can change the opportunity set, there is no reason that firms necessarily will maximize market value.&quot; (fn. 15, p. 791)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stiglitz elaborates: if an individual chooses his portfolio to maximize εU(Y(θ)), where U'' &lt; 0, then the first-order conditions for the optimal allocation may be written εU'e_i = εU'r*, or from equation (2), [εU'(X_j - r̃_jB_j)]/S. Assuming U'(Y(θ)) is invariant for all θ and for all individuals to the j^th firm's debt-equity ratio, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dE_j/dB_j = -(r̃_j/r*)(1 + d ln r̃_j / d ln B_j)(εU''/εU')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and if the value of the firm is to be unchanged, dE_j/dB_j = -1. &quot;But unless all individuals have identical utility functions and identical assessments of the probability of bankruptcy (εU''/εU'), dE_j/dB_j will differ for different individuals, so dE_j/dB_j = -1 only if marginal utilities in some states of nature change for some individuals.&quot;</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy and Perfect Capital Markets (pp. 791-792)</h3>
<p>Stiglitz argues that bankruptcy makes the interpretation of an &quot;imperfect capital market&quot; questionable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The crucial fallacy lies in the implicit assumption that one firm's bond is identical to another firm's bond, and that bonds a firm issues when it has a low debt-equity ratio and those which it issues when it has a high debt-equity ratio are the same. But they are not. They give different patterns of returns. If there is any chance of default, a bond gives a variable return (i.e. is a risky asset). Just as there is no reason to expect butter and cheese, even though they are related commodities, to have the same price, so there is no reason to expect the nominal rate of interest where there is a low debt-equity ratio to be the same as when there is a high debt-equity ratio.&quot; (p. 792)</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Footnote 15: The Objective Function Is Not Settled</h3>
<p>Stiglitz's observation that &quot;there is no reason that firms necessarily will maximize market value&quot; is a remarkable admission from within the formal apparatus of MM theory itself. When bankruptcy is possible and individuals have heterogeneous preferences, the conditions under which value maximization is the &quot;correct&quot; objective function break down. This creates theoretical space for alternative objectives like EPS maximization.</p>
<h3>2. MM Holds Under Even WEAKER Assumptions — Making the Puzzle Deeper</h3>
<p>By showing that MM holds without risk classes, without competitive markets, and without agreement on probability distributions, Stiglitz makes the gap between theory and practice WIDER. If MM holds under such general conditions, why do firms behave as if capital structure matters? The EPS paradigm answers: because managers optimize EPS, not firm value.</p>
<h3>3. The Bankruptcy Exception Is the Practical Exception</h3>
<p>The one case where Stiglitz shows MM may fail — bankruptcy — is precisely the case that matters in practice. Every real firm has some probability of default. Stiglitz's proof that MM requires either no bankruptcy or the ability of individuals to replicate firm leverage using collateral arrangements means that the theorem's applicability to real firms is questionable.</p>
<h3>4. The &quot;Risk Class&quot; Observation Supports EPS</h3>
<p>Stiglitz notes that observing firms in the same risk class with the same value but different debt-equity ratios &quot;is not necessarily evidence that the arbitrage activities described by Modigliani and Miller have occurred.&quot; Firms may simply have different debt-equity ratios for other reasons (like EPS optimization) that happen not to affect value under MM conditions.</p>
<h3>5. The Arrow-Debreu Framework Shows the Theory's Limits</h3>
<p>Stiglitz's Arrow-Debreu analysis shows that MM requires either complete markets (more securities than states of nature) or homogeneous beliefs. Since real markets are incomplete and beliefs are heterogeneous, the theorem's practical applicability is limited — leaving room for EPS-based capital structure choices to have real effects.</p>
