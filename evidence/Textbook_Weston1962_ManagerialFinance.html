    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>J. Fred Weston's <em>Managerial Finance</em> (1962) is a critical transitional document, written just four years after Modigliani-Miller (1958). Weston explicitly uses the <strong>earnings-price ratio (E/P) as the cost of equity</strong> — the exact practice that Brealey &amp; Myers would later spend three chapters demolishing. More remarkably, Weston directly confronts the tension between EPS maximization and value maximization, showing with a worked numerical example that <em>they can give different answers</em>, and that the &quot;practical&quot; manager's instinct favors EPS while &quot;economic theory&quot; favors value. The book captures the moment when the old paradigm (earnings capitalization) was still the standard approach, but the new paradigm (MM/NPV) was knocking on the door.</p>

      <h2>1. The Firm's Objective: &quot;Management of Funds&quot; — No Explicit Objective Function</h2>
<p>Unlike later textbooks, Weston does not begin with a clear statement of the firm's objective. Chapter 1 defines financial management as &quot;the responsibility for obtaining and effectively utilizing the funds necessary for the efficient operation of an enterprise.&quot; The finance function centers on &quot;the <em>management</em> of funds — raising and using them effectively&quot; (p. 1).</p>
<p>The preface describes &quot;a theme running through the entire book&quot; as &quot;the important and probably leading contribution that financial managers can and should be making in the <em>planning and control</em> functions of business management.&quot; Financial management &quot;has undergone a revolution&quot; — from merely raising funds to active planning and control.</p>
<p>This is significant: Weston frames finance as a <em>process</em> (managing funds efficiently) rather than as an <em>optimization</em> (maximize X). The book operates in the pre-objective-function era of corporate finance, where the manager's job is described functionally rather than mathematically.</p>
<h2>2. Cost of Equity = Earnings-Price Ratio (E/P)</h2>
<p>This is the most important finding for the EPS paradigm project. On p. 232, Weston states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are two major ways of calculating the cost of common stock: the dividend-yield basis and the earnings-price basis, or price-earnings ratio.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He immediately dismisses dividend yield:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The use of the dividend-yield basis is clearly not appropriate, in view of wide variations in dividend pay-out policies... Growth firms often pay little or no cash dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Competent studies indicate that the dividend pay-out rate, whether high or low, does not have a determinant influence on stock prices generally. The main influence upon stock prices for the firm is its underlying earning power rather than the percentage of earnings paid out in dividends.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the key conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The price-earnings (or the earnings-price) ratio is therefore the best dependable basis for calculating the cost of common stock, <strong>and this is the ratio that will be employed.</strong>&quot; (p. 232, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Baker Company WACC Calculation</h3>
<p>In the Baker Company example (pp. 233-235), the cost of equity is simply the E/P ratio:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPS = $1.12, Price = $22.40, so E/P = 5%</li>
<li>This 5% is used directly as the cost of common stock in the WACC</li>
<li>WACC (Method A, market weights + market yields) = 4.47%</li>
</ul>
<h3>The U.S. Steel WACC Calculation</h3>
<p>For U.S. Steel (pp. 236-237):</p>
<ul>
<li>Common stock earnings = $4.25/share, market price = $98.50</li>
<li>Earnings yield = 4.3%</li>
<li>WACC (Method A) = 4.18%</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, E/P is used as the cost of equity without any adjustment for growth, risk, or PVGO. This is exactly what Brealey &amp; Myers (2000) would later warn is a mistake — &quot;managers frequently make poor financial decisions because they confuse earnings-price ratios with the market capitalization rate.&quot;</p>
<h2>3. The EPS vs. Value Maximization Tension</h2>
<p>The most extraordinary passage appears on pp. 229-230, where Weston directly confronts the fact that EPS maximization and value maximization can give different answers:</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>A firm has: Total assets $100,000; Debt $20,000 (4%); Net worth $80,000; EPS $1.12; P/E = 20; Stock price = $22.40. The firm needs $40,000 for expansion (also earning 12%).</p>
<p>Two options: sell debt at 6% (E/P rises from 5% to 6%) or sell equity at $20/share.</p>

<h3>Weston's Commentary</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Economic theory prescribes the rule that the investor maximize the present worth of future earnings; the investor should maximize wealth — the market value per share of the common stock. Following the rule of maximizing wealth, the management of the firm in the example should finance with common stock, because it produces the higher indicated market price per share of stock. If for some <strong>'practical' reasons</strong>, earnings per share is the guide, financing by debt has a small edge.&quot; (p. 230, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage is a Rosetta Stone for the paradigm transition. Weston:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledges that &quot;economic theory&quot; says maximize value (stock price)</li>
<li>Acknowledges that &quot;practical&quot; managers use EPS as their guide</li>
<li>Shows that the two criteria give <strong>opposite answers</strong> for the debt-vs-equity choice</li>
<li>Notes that the difference arises because debt financing raises the capitalization rate (from 5% to 6%), which offsets the EPS increase</li>
</ol>
<p>The scare quotes around &quot;practical&quot; are telling — Weston knows that EPS maximization is what managers actually do, but he cannot quite endorse it as the theoretically correct objective.</p>
<h2>4. Capitalization Rates from Comps</h2>
<p>In the remarkable footnote 6 on p. 242, Weston explains how capitalization rates are determined in practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since the use of debt involves greater risk, a higher capitalization rate should be applied to financing arrangements for debt. The 10 percent and 8 percent are arbitrary capitalization rates. <strong>In practice, these rates would be determined by observing the capitalization rates of two companies in the same industry, generally similar in all other respects except for differing debt-to-equity ratios.</strong> The differences in the rates at which common-stock earnings are capitalized into market prices will provide some guide for determining the appropriate capitalization rate for a similar firm contemplating financing by debt.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the <strong>comps approach</strong> to determining the cost of equity — exactly the method the EPS paradigm describes. You don't derive the cost of equity from a risk model (CAPM didn't exist yet); you observe it from comparable firms' earnings yields. The capitalization rate is an empirically observed market price, not a theoretically derived required return.</p>
<h2>5. The Leverage Decision: EPS Breakeven AND Capitalized Value</h2>
<p>The Universal Machine Company example (pp. 240-243) is Weston's most elaborate worked example. He computes EPS under debt vs. equity financing at various sales levels, then capitalizes those EPS figures at different rates to get stock prices.</p>
<p><strong>Table 11-6</strong> shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financing by bonds: EPS at $600K sales = $1.04, capitalized at 10% = $10.40</li>
<li>Financing by common stock: EPS at $600K sales = $0.72, capitalized at 8% = $9.00</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figure 11-1</strong> (p. 242): Break-even chart for EPS vs. sales — debt financing wins above $200K sales
<strong>Figure 11-2</strong> (p. 243): Break-even chart for <em>capitalized value of EPS</em> vs. sales — debt financing doesn't win until $300K sales</p>
<p>Weston's key insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The analysis should not stop with the calculation of earnings per share on common stock. It must also take into consideration the rates at which earnings are likely to be capitalized into common-stock values.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same point Brealey &amp; Myers would make 38 years later with the Macbeth Spot Removers example — but Weston makes it gently, as a practical refinement to EPS analysis, not as a devastating critique of EPS-focused thinking. He does NOT say EPS analysis is wrong; he says it's incomplete.</p>
<h2>6. Weston vs. MM: The Traditional View</h2>
<p>In the Appendix (Ch. 11a, pp. 255-260), Weston presents MM's three propositions clearly but explicitly disagrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My presentation in Chapter 11 assumes that business leverage involves risks that cannot be offset by adjustments in individual leverage. My assumptions lead to the pattern of relationships indicated by Figure 11-3.&quot; (p. 255)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 11-3 shows the traditional &quot;saucer-shaped&quot; cost of capital curve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earnings yield on common stock</strong>: flat until ~40% leverage, then rises sharply</li>
<li><strong>Yield on debt</strong>: flat until ~50% leverage, then rises</li>
<li><strong>Overall cost of capital</strong>: gently declining (saucer-shaped), with a minimum around 40-60% leverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Weston cites his own empirical work on electric utilities (1959 data) finding &quot;both horizontal cost-of-equity and cost-of-debt functions&quot; with a negative slope for the overall cost of capital — i.e., leverage lowers the cost of capital, at least within the typical range.</p>
<p>He notes that MM's own findings (1947-1948 utility data showing rising cost of equity) &quot;are therefore consistent with a saucer-shaped cost-of-capital function over a wide range of leverage&quot; — not with their own theory of an irrelevance result.</p>
<h2>Significance for the EPS Paradigm Project</h2>
<p>Weston 1962 is the <strong>last major textbook</strong> to use E/P as the cost of equity before the NPV revolution transformed corporate finance pedagogy. Its significance is multifold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Documents the pre-NPV standard practice.</strong> When Weston writes &quot;this is the ratio that will be employed&quot; (p. 232), he is describing the consensus method, not an idiosyncratic choice. The E/P ratio was how everyone measured the cost of equity before CAPM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Captures the exact moment of paradigm tension.</strong> The passage on p. 230 — where EPS maximization and value maximization give opposite answers — is the clearest statement in the textbook literature of the conflict between the two paradigms. Weston sees it, names it, and cannot resolve it. He leans toward &quot;economic theory&quot; (value maximization) but acknowledges the pull of &quot;practical&quot; reasoning (EPS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shows the comps method was standard.</strong> Footnote 6's description of determining capitalization rates &quot;by observing the capitalization rates of two companies in the same industry&quot; is exactly the comps-based pricing that the EPS paradigm describes. This was not an innovation — it was the only available method before factor models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reveals what MM was arguing against.</strong> The worked examples in Chapter 11 — where EPS is computed under alternative financing schemes, capitalized at comps-derived rates, and compared — are the exact type of analysis that MM's Proposition I says is irrelevant and Proposition II says is misleading. Weston's textbook shows what &quot;normal&quot; corporate finance looked like before MM won the argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The leverage analysis is incomplete by Weston's own admission.</strong> He says the analysis &quot;should not stop with the calculation of earnings per share&quot; but should also consider capitalization rates. However, his capitalization rates are still E/P ratios from comps — not risk-adjusted discount rates from a model. The improvement he proposes stays within the earnings-capitalization framework; it just adds a second step (adjust the E/P for risk). This is not the NPV framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weston himself was a transitional figure.</strong> He was a serious academic (UCLA) who later co-authored the influential <em>Managerial Finance</em> with Eugene Brigham (1966), which began to incorporate more of the MM framework. This 1962 edition represents his thinking before the full absorption of MM theory into textbooks.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong>: Published one year later. Solomon's <em>Theory of Financial Management</em> would complete the paradigm shift by explicitly arguing that the firm's objective should be to maximize market value, not EPS. Weston in 1962 is on the cusp — he sees the tension but doesn't fully resolve it.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong>: Uses E/P as cost of equity while introducing capital budgeting — the same approach Weston follows a decade later. Both are pre-CAPM, pre-Gordon-growth-model practitioners.</li>
<li><strong>Brealey &amp; Myers (2000)</strong>: Their three-chapter demolition of EPS reasoning is a direct rebuttal of the type of analysis Weston presents. The Macbeth Spot Removers example (leverage boosts EPS but not stock price) is a sharper version of Weston's Universal Machine Company example.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong>, <strong>Gerstenberg (1924)</strong>, <strong>Dewing (1920)</strong>: The earlier textbooks that Weston builds on. All use earnings capitalization as the primary valuation method. Weston is the last in this line before the revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Copeland &amp; Weston (1988)</strong>: Weston's later textbook (with Copeland) fully adopts the NPV framework with CAPM-based cost of equity. The contrast between Weston 1962 and Copeland/Weston 1988 — by the same author — documents the paradigm shift in a single career.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong>: Weston is one of the first textbook authors to engage with MM, but he disagrees on the key assumption (homemade leverage). His &quot;saucer-shaped&quot; cost of capital curve represents the traditional view that an optimal capital structure exists.</li>
