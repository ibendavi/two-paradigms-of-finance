    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Fama's 1970 Journal of Finance paper is the canonical formalization of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH). It defines an efficient market as one where &quot;prices always 'fully reflect' available information,&quot; formalizes this through the &quot;fair game&quot; model, and categorizes tests into three forms: <strong>weak</strong> (past prices), <strong>semi-strong</strong> (all public information), and <strong>strong</strong> (all information including private). The paper reviews an extensive body of empirical evidence and concludes that &quot;the evidence in support of the efficient markets model is extensive, and (somewhat uniquely in economics) contradictory evidence is sparse.&quot; This paper defined the research agenda for financial economics for the next two decades and remains the single most cited paper in the field.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Definition (p. 383)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A market in which prices always 'fully reflect' available information is called 'efficient.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper acknowledges this is imprecise and requires formal models to give it testable content.</p>
<h3>The Fair Game Model (pp. 384-388)</h3>
<p>The formal condition for market efficiency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E(p̃_{j,t+1} | Φ_t) = [1 + E(r̃_{j,t+1} | Φ_t)] · p_{jt}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where Φ_t is the information set available at time t. This says: the expected future price, given current information, equals the current price times one plus the expected return.</p>
<p>Equivalently, define excess market value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>x_{j,t+1} = p_{j,t+1} - E(p̃_{j,t+1} | Φ_t)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E(x̃_{j,t+1} | Φ_t) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the &quot;fair game&quot; condition: <strong>no trading system based on available information can earn expected excess returns.</strong> The sequence {x_{jt}} is a fair game with respect to information Φ_t.</p>
<p>Two special cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Submartingale model:</strong> E(p̃_{j,t+1} | Φ_t) ≥ p_{jt} — expected returns are non-negative. Implies buy-and-hold cannot be beaten.</li>
<li><strong>Random walk model:</strong> Successive returns are independent AND identically distributed. Stronger than needed for efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Three Forms (pp. 388, 404, 409)</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Form</th>
<th>Information Set (Φ_t)</th>
<th>Tests</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Weak</strong></td>
<td>Past prices only</td>
<td>Serial correlations, runs tests, filter rules</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Semi-strong</strong></td>
<td>All publicly available information</td>
<td>Event studies (splits, earnings, new issues)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Strong</strong></td>
<td>All information (including private/insider)</td>
<td>Mutual fund performance, specialist/insider profits</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Weak Form Evidence (pp. 394-403)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serial correlations:</strong> Small but statistically significant positive dependence in daily returns; economically insignificant</li>
<li><strong>Runs tests:</strong> Slight positive dependence confirmed</li>
<li><strong>Filter rules:</strong> Small filters (≤1.5%) sometimes profitable before costs, never after</li>
<li><strong>Spectral analysis:</strong> No cyclical patterns exploitable for trading</li>
<li>Conclusion: &quot;the results are strongly in support&quot; of weak-form efficiency</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semi-Strong Form Evidence (pp. 404-409)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFJR (1969) stock splits:</strong> Abnormal returns disappear immediately after the split month; market adjusts prices rapidly to new information</li>
<li><strong>Ball &amp; Brown (1968) earnings:</strong> Market anticipates most of the earnings information before the announcement; post-announcement drift is small</li>
<li><strong>Scholes (1969) secondary offerings:</strong> Market adjusts prices downward before the offering is publicly announced (information leakage)</li>
<li><strong>New issues:</strong> Evidence that market rapidly incorporates information about IPOs</li>
<li>Conclusion: &quot;semi-strong form tests... are also consistent with the efficient markets model&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strong Form Evidence (pp. 409-415)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual fund performance:</strong> Jensen (1968) found 89 of 115 funds earned below the market line over 10 years. Even gross of expenses, 72 of 115 underperformed. &quot;There is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Corporate insiders:</strong> Some evidence that insiders earn above-average returns — the ONE area where strong-form efficiency fails</li>
<li><strong>NYSE specialists:</strong> Make monopoly profits from their order book — another exception</li>
<li>Conclusion: strong-form efficiency fails for insiders and specialists but holds for professional fund managers</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Joint Hypothesis Problem (pp. 388, 414)</h3>
<p>A critical caveat that would haunt the EMH literature for decades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing market efficiency requires a model of &quot;normal&quot; expected returns (e.g., CAPM)</li>
<li>If the test rejects efficiency, it could be because the market is inefficient OR because the expected return model is wrong</li>
<li>You can never test efficiency alone — it is always a <strong>joint test</strong> of efficiency + the asset pricing model</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In short, the evidence in support of the efficient markets model is extensive, and (somewhat uniquely in economics) contradictory evidence is sparse.&quot; (p. 416)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For the purposes of most investors the efficient markets model seems a good first approximation to reality.&quot; (p. 416)</p>
</blockquote>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Organizing Framework for Financial Economics</h3>
<p>The weak/semi-strong/strong taxonomy became the standard framework for organizing empirical work in finance. Nearly every empirical paper from 1970 to 1990 positioned itself within this classification.</p>
<h3>2. The Challenge to Active Management</h3>
<p>If markets are efficient, professional fund managers cannot consistently beat the market. This led directly to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The index fund revolution (Bogle/Vanguard, 1975)</li>
<li>The passive investing movement</li>
<li>The persistent tension between Wall Street (which sells active management) and academia (which says it doesn't work)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. The Joint Hypothesis Problem</h3>
<p>Fama honestly identified the central weakness in his own framework: you can never test efficiency alone. This loophole would be exploited by behavioral finance (anomalies might reflect mispricing OR bad risk models) and by the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model (which &quot;explained&quot; anomalies by adding risk factors).</p>
<h3>4. The Semi-Strong Form and Event Studies</h3>
<p>The semi-strong form tests — especially FFJR (1969) on stock splits — created an entire methodology: the <strong>event study</strong>, which remains the standard tool for measuring the market impact of corporate events. This methodology would be central to corporate finance, securities regulation, and litigation.</p>
<h3>5. The Foundation for the Academic-Practitioner Divide</h3>
<p>This paper more than any other created the intellectual divide between academic finance (markets are efficient, you can't beat the market) and practitioner finance (careful analysis can identify mispriced securities). The divide persists to this day.</p>
