    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Bradshaw &amp; Sloan's 2002 <em>Journal of Accounting Research</em> paper documents a dramatic and growing divergence between GAAP earnings (from Compustat) and &quot;Street&quot; earnings (from I/B/E/S) over the period 1985-1997. Street earnings exclude items that analysts and tracking services consider &quot;nonrecurring&quot; -- special items, restructuring charges, write-downs, goodwill amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. The central finding: investors increasingly price Street earnings rather than GAAP earnings. Post-1992, the Street earnings response coefficient (ERC) is 1.027 while the GAAP ERC is just 0.081 (F-test p=0.0001). The R-squared using Street earnings rises to ~6% while the R-squared using GAAP earnings falls to ~3%. The paper also shows that MANAGERS drive this shift: analysis of 400 earnings announcements reveals that in 1986-1987, 83% of announcements discussed GAAP earnings only, while by 1998-1999, only 28% discussed GAAP only and 42% led with Street earnings. When both are presented in 1998-1999, Street earnings appear on average 2.1 paragraphs earlier than GAAP -- managers proactively highlight the Street number. For the EPS project, this paper documents the precise evolution of WHICH EPS the market capitalizes: not GAAP EPS (which is confounded by one-time charges), but a cleaned-up, &quot;sustainable&quot; EPS that reflects ongoing earning power. The EPS in P = EPS x P/E is Street EPS, and both analysts and managers have converged on this definition -- exactly as Dichev et al. (2013) find that CFOs define high-quality earnings as &quot;sustainable, repeatable, recurring.&quot;</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 41-45)</h3>
<p><strong>The puzzle:</strong> Two databases -- Compustat and I/B/E/S -- track corporate earnings, but they increasingly disagree about what the number is. Compustat reports GAAP earnings (before extraordinary items and discontinued operations). I/B/E/S reports &quot;Street&quot; earnings -- the number analysts actually forecast and firms actually announce as their headline result. The gap has been growing.</p>
<p><strong>Five predictions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P1:</strong> The gap between Street and GAAP earnings has been growing over time.</li>
<li><strong>P2:</strong> The market-pricing association is stronger for Street earnings than GAAP earnings.</li>
<li><strong>P3:</strong> The frequency and magnitude of special items have been increasing.</li>
<li><strong>P4:</strong> I/B/E/S has been excluding an increasing portion of special items from Street earnings.</li>
<li><strong>P5:</strong> Managers have been increasingly emphasizing Street earnings in their announcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>All five are confirmed.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Data and Methodology (pp. 47-50)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> I/B/E/S, Compustat, CRSP. Quarterly data, 1985-1997. 108,864 firm-quarter observations.</p>
<p><strong>Key variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EPS_GAAP:</strong> Compustat earnings before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, adjusted for stock splits, scaled by stock price.</li>
<li><strong>EPS_Street:</strong> I/B/E/S actual EPS -- the number the tracking service reports as the firm's actual earnings.</li>
<li><strong>DIFF = (EPS_Street - EPS_GAAP) / Price:</strong> The scaled gap between the two definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Special Items (SI):</strong> Compustat quarterly special items, scaled by price.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 4.1: Growing Divergence (Figure 1, Table 3)</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Time-series plot of mean GAAP and Street EPS (scaled by price). The two lines begin together around 1985 and diverge dramatically starting ~1992. By 1997, the gap averages about 1% of stock price per quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Table 3 -- Time trend:</strong> DIFF = 0.0040 + 0.0004 x YEAR. The year coefficient (0.0004) is significant at 1% -- the gap grows by 0.04% of stock price per year.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2 -- Earnings growth:</strong> Street mean quarterly EPS growth is 7.1% vs. GAAP mean of 4.9%. The 2.2 percentage point difference is highly significant. Street earnings grow faster because they systematically exclude negative items.</p>
<h3>Section 4.2: Value Relevance (Table 1, Figure 2)</h3>
<p><strong>The key test.</strong> Returns are regressed on forecast errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return = a + b x (Actual - Forecast) / Price + e</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where &quot;Actual&quot; is either GAAP or Street EPS.</p>

</table>
<p>In the early period, both ERCs are moderate. By 1993-1997, the Street ERC has risen to 1.027 while the GAAP ERC has COLLAPSED to 0.081 (essentially zero). A one-standard-deviation Street surprise moves stock prices by ~5%; a one-standard-deviation GAAP surprise moves prices by ~0.4%.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2 -- R-squared:</strong> Time series of R-squared from returns-earnings regressions. Street R-squared rises from ~3% to ~6%. GAAP R-squared falls from ~3% to ~1%. The lines CROSS around 1992 -- the moment Street earnings became more value-relevant than GAAP earnings.</p>
<h3>Section 4.3-4.4: Special Items Explain the Gap (Figures 3-4, Table 4)</h3>
<p><strong>Figures 3-4:</strong> Both the frequency and magnitude of negative special items (restructuring charges, write-downs) have increased over 1985-1997. The mean absolute magnitude of special items approximately doubles.</p>
<p><strong>Table 4:</strong> Regression of DIFF on special items and interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SI coefficient: negative and significant (Street earnings exclude negative special items)</li>
<li><strong>SI x YEAR interaction: -0.0035, significant</strong> -- I/B/E/S excludes an INCREASING fraction of special items over time. By 1997 Q4, approximately 78% of special items are excluded from Street earnings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section 4.5-4.6: Forecast Errors (Figure 5)</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Time series of forecast errors, partitioned by the sign of special items.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panel A (GAAP):</strong> For firms with negative special items (SI&lt;0), GAAP-based forecast errors become increasingly NEGATIVE over time, reaching -12% of stock price by 1997. Analysts forecast Street earnings, so when GAAP is measured against Street forecasts, the gap appears as &quot;analyst optimism.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Panel B (Street):</strong> Forecast errors are stable and near zero regardless of special items sign.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key implication:</strong> The well-documented &quot;decline in analyst optimism&quot; is partly an artifact of the growing GAAP-Street gap. When analysts appear less optimistic over time, it's partly because the earnings number they're forecasting (Street) has moved further from the earnings number researchers measure them against (GAAP).</p>
<h3>Section 4.7: Managers Drive the Shift (Table 5)</h3>
<p><strong>400 earnings announcements analyzed:</strong> 200 from 1986-1987, 200 from 1998-1999. All are cases where Street &gt; GAAP (conditional on a gap existing).</p>
<p><strong>Table 5, Panel A -- Which earnings are discussed:</strong></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The shift is dramatic: from 82.5% GAAP-only to 28.0% GAAP-only. From 6.5% Street-first to 42.0% Street-first. Chi-square test of independence: 122.3 (p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p><strong>Table 5, Panel B -- Paragraph placement:</strong></p>
<p>In 1998-1999, when Street earnings are presented first, there is a significant mean spread of <strong>2.1 paragraphs</strong> between the Street figure (presented earlier) and the GAAP figure (buried deeper). This spread is significantly larger than 0.5 when GAAP is first.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> &quot;The evidence indicates that in recent periods, managers emphasize Street earnings earlier than GAAP earnings within press releases... managers are proactive in the promotion of Street earnings&quot; (p. 64).</p>
<h3>Section 5: Conclusion and Implications (pp. 64-66)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We document a marked increase in the exclusion of significant expenses from the earnings reported by analyst tracking services, and a corresponding increase in firms specifically identifying large portions of their expenses as nonrecurring. This change in the reporting environment has resulted in a growing disparity between earnings under GAAP and earnings followed by the Street.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Implications for value relevance research:</strong> The apparent decline in value relevance of GAAP earnings documented by Collins, Maydew &amp; Weiss (1997) and Francis &amp; Schipper (1999) is at least partly due to the growing exclusion of items from Street earnings. Street earnings have actually become MORE value-relevant, not less.</p>
<p><strong>The &quot;cash earnings&quot; trend:</strong> Footnote 21 notes that First Call (now part of Thomson Reuters) has begun accepting forecasts of &quot;cash earnings&quot; that exclude goodwill amortization. &quot;Managers and analysts are extending the list of 'ignored' expenses to include other expenses&quot; beyond special items.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Identifies WHICH EPS the Market Capitalizes</h3>
<p>In P = EPS x P/E, which EPS? Not GAAP EPS -- Street EPS. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan show that by the 1990s, the market prices Street earnings almost exclusively (ERC = 1.027) while GAAP earnings have essentially zero pricing power (ERC = 0.081). This resolves the &quot;which EPS?&quot; ambiguity that Pringle (1973) raised as a critique: the market has settled on a specific definition -- sustainable, recurring earnings net of one-time items -- and that is the EPS that gets capitalized.</p>
<h3>2. Street EPS = &quot;Sustainable&quot; EPS = Capitalizable EPS</h3>
<p>The items excluded from Street earnings -- restructuring charges, asset write-downs, goodwill amortization, stock-based compensation -- are precisely the items that make earnings LESS capitalizable. A one-time $500M restructuring charge is not a permanent earning power reduction, so capitalizing (GAAP EPS including the charge) x P/E would undervalue the firm. Street EPS removes these transitory items to produce a sustainable earnings number suitable for capitalization -- exactly what Dichev et al. (2013) find CFOs mean by &quot;high-quality earnings.&quot;</p>
<h3>3. Managers Actively Construct the EPS That Gets Capitalized</h3>
<p>The Table 5 evidence -- managers shifting from GAAP-only announcements (82.5% in 1986-87) to Street-first announcements (42.0% in 1998-99) -- shows that managers are not passive price-takers. They actively shape the earnings number that investors use. This is the EPS paradigm in action: managers know P = EPS x P/E, so they work to define the EPS that enters the equation, ensuring it is as high and as sustainable-looking as possible.</p>
<h3>4. The Growing Gap Documents EPS Construction in Real Time</h3>
<p>The divergence starting ~1992 captures a specific historical episode in the evolution of the EPS paradigm. As special items proliferated (restructuring charges became fashionable in the early 1990s), the market's pricing of earnings could have broken down. Instead, a new &quot;Street&quot; definition emerged that filtered out the noise, preserving the P = EPS x P/E relationship. The paradigm is adaptive -- when GAAP earnings become less suitable for capitalization, the market creates a better earnings number.</p>
<h3>5. Resolves the &quot;Declining Value Relevance&quot; Puzzle</h3>
<p>Collins, Maydew &amp; Weiss (1997) and others documented that the R-squared of returns on GAAP earnings had been declining. This was interpreted as evidence that earnings were becoming less important for pricing. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan show this is wrong: Street earnings have become MORE important (higher ERC, higher R-squared). The decline is in the wrong DEFINITION of earnings, not in the role of earnings in pricing. For the EPS paradigm, this is critical: earnings-based pricing is not declining -- it is evolving.</p>
<h3>6. Analyst Forecasts Are Street Forecasts = The EPS Target</h3>
<p>The fact that analyst forecasts (from I/B/E/S) track Street earnings, not GAAP earnings, means the entire &quot;earnings benchmark&quot; literature -- meeting or beating analyst forecasts -- is about STREET EPS. When Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005) report that 67.1% say EPS is important, and when Dichev et al. (2013) report that 93.5% say the motivation for earnings management is stock price, the EPS they're targeting is Street EPS. The consensus forecast IS the Street EPS target.</p>
<h3>7. The &quot;Analyst Optimism&quot; Reinterpretation</h3>
<p>The apparent decline in analyst forecast optimism may be an artifact of the GAAP-Street gap. This matters for asset pricing research that relies on analyst forecast errors as a measure of expectations biases. If optimism is really a measurement issue (using GAAP actuals against Street forecasts), then some documented &quot;anomalies&quot; may not exist.</p>
<h3>8. Fair Value vs. Matching Debate</h3>
<p>Bradshaw &amp; Sloan's finding reinforces why CFOs in Dichev et al. (2013) overwhelmingly prefer matching (92.2%) over fair value: matching produces sustainable, capitalizable earnings (=Street earnings), while fair value produces volatile GAAP earnings that investors ignore. The accounting method choice is partly about producing the &quot;right&quot; EPS for capitalization.</p>

<li><strong>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2013)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field.&quot; CFOs define high-quality earnings as &quot;sustainable, repeatable, recurring&quot; and &quot;free from one-time items&quot; -- exactly the properties of Street earnings that Bradshaw &amp; Sloan show are priced. The 92.2% preference for matching over fair value also reflects the desire for capitalizable (= Street-like) earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> -- &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; 67.1% say EPS is very important for financial reporting. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan identify WHICH EPS: Street EPS, the sustainable number that strips out special items. The &quot;EPS benchmark&quot; in Graham et al. is the Street consensus forecast.</li>
<li><strong>Collins, Maydew &amp; Weiss (1997)</strong> -- &quot;Changes in the Value-Relevance of Earnings and Book Values over the Past Forty Years.&quot; Document declining GAAP earnings relevance. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan provide the explanation: Street earnings have displaced GAAP in investor pricing, so the &quot;decline&quot; is a substitution, not a disappearance.</li>
<li><strong>Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses.&quot; The discontinuity at zero in the distribution of earnings. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan add the question: is the discontinuity in GAAP or Street earnings? If firms manage Street earnings (the number investors price), the benchmark literature should use Street definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Roychowdhury (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Management through Real Activities Manipulation.&quot; Roychowdhury tests manipulation around earnings thresholds. The threshold is effectively a Street EPS target -- the number investors price and analysts forecast.</li>
<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Repurchases boost EPS by reducing share count. The EPS they're boosting is Street EPS -- the number that gets priced per Bradshaw &amp; Sloan.</li>
<li><strong>Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy (2003)</strong> -- &quot;Differences in Commercial Database Reported Earnings.&quot; Cited by Bradshaw &amp; Sloan. Documents the same GAAP vs. Street discrepancies across databases. The measurement issue affects all empirical earnings research.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida (2019)</strong> -- &quot;Is It Time to Get Rid of Earnings-per-Share (EPS)?&quot; Almeida's critique targets EPS -- but which EPS? Bradshaw &amp; Sloan show it's Street EPS that drives behavior. The &quot;pro forma&quot; or &quot;adjusted&quot; EPS that firms report is the version managers optimize and investors price.</li>
<li><strong>Pringle (1973)</strong> -- &quot;Price Earnings Ratios, Earnings-Per-Share, and Financial Management.&quot; Pringle criticized EPS for ambiguity: &quot;Which EPS to maximize?&quot; Bradshaw &amp; Sloan show the market has answered: Street EPS -- sustainable, recurring earnings excluding special items. The ambiguity Pringle identified has been resolved in practice.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> -- Bradshaw &amp; Sloan identify the specific EPS that enters P = EPS x P/E. It is Street EPS -- the I/B/E/S actual, not the GAAP number. This matters for empirical tests: the earnings yield should be computed using Street EPS, not Compustat EPS. The accretion condition E/P &gt; r_d(1-T_c) uses the Street-defined E.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> -- The investor-side companion paper models P = E(EPS) x P/E. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan document that the E(EPS) in analyst forecasts is Street EPS, and the &quot;actual EPS&quot; used to compute forecast errors is also Street EPS. The entire I/B/E/S ecosystem -- forecasts, actuals, surprises -- operates on Street definitions. This is the &quot;E&quot; in the pricing equation.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> -- The evolution from GAAP-only announcements (1986-87) to Street-first announcements (1998-99) is a specific episode in the history of the EPS paradigm. The paradigm didn't start using Street earnings in 1985 -- it evolved to emphasize them as GAAP became less suitable for capitalization. This adaptability is evidence of a robust paradigm, not a fixed heuristic.</li>
