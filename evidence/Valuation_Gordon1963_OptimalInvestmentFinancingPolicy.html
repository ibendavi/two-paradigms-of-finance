    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Gordon's 1963 <em>Journal of Finance</em> paper, presented at the AFA meetings with discussions by Solomon, Lintner, Walter, and Vandell (chaired by Fred Weston), is his definitive statement against Miller &amp; Modigliani's dividend irrelevance theorem. Gordon's core argument: under uncertainty, investors discount distant dividends at higher rates than near dividends (k_t increases with t), so shifting earnings from near dividends to distant dividends (via retention) raises the average discount rate and LOWERS share price. The formal model yields P₀ = (1-b)Y₀/(k-br) and its extension P₀ = A₀[(1-b)Y₀][1+br]^α₂, where α₂ captures how much investors are willing to pay for growth. Gordon directly challenges MM's &quot;imputed rationality&quot; defense — MM's claim that dividend preference would be irrational because investors could sell shares to create &quot;homemade dividends&quot; — by arguing that the uncertainty of future capital gains makes them an imperfect substitute for current dividends. The paper concludes with an extraordinary passage identifying the practitioners vs. academics divide on cost of capital.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Opening Challenge to MM (p. 264)</h3>
<p>Gordon opens with a direct challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In two papers and in a recent book I have presented theory and evidence which lead to the conclusion that a corporation's share price (or its cost of capital) is not independent of the dividend rate. As you may know, MM (Modigliani and Miller) have the opposite view, and they argued their position at some length in a recent paper. Moreover, the tone of their paper made it clear that they saw no reasonable basis on which their conclusion could be questioned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section I: Examining MM's Proof (pp. 264-266)</h3>
<p>Gordon begins by reviewing MM's dividend irrelevance proof. MM define:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = (1/(1+k))[D₁ + P₁] (equation 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and show that if the firm raises its dividend but keeps investment constant by selling new shares, the sum D₁ + P₁ remains unchanged, so P₀ is independent of D₁.</p>
<p>Gordon's critique: MM proved this under CERTAINTY, then extended it to uncertainty by invoking &quot;imputed rationality&quot; and &quot;symmetric market rationality.&quot; Gordon challenges this extension:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;after proving the theorem a number of times under different conditions, they withdrew the assumption of certainty and made the dramatic announcement, 'our first step, alas, must be to jettison the fundamental valuation equation.' Under uncertainty, they continued, it is not 'at all clear what meaning can be attached to the discount factor...'&quot; (p. 265)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then MM rescued their conclusion by &quot;the postulates of 'imputed rationality' and 'symmetric market rationality.'&quot; Gordon finds this rescue unconvincing.</p>
<h3>Section II: The Dividend Proof via Discount Rates (pp. 266-268)</h3>
<p>Gordon presents his own proof. Starting from the no-growth case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = V₀/(1+k)¹ + V₀/(1+k)² + ... (equation 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the firm retains and invests earning rate k (= return on investment), the dividend stream shifts to later periods but P₀ is unchanged — Gordon agrees with MM here for the case where r = k (return on investment equals required return).</p>
<p>But if the firm announces a CHANGE in dividend policy (shifting from equation 2 to equation 3, with lower near dividends and higher distant dividends), Gordon argues that investors will raise their discount rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Assume now that when the corporation makes the announcement which changes the dividend expectation from the one given by equation (2) to the one given by equation (3), investors raise the discount rate from k to k'.&quot; (p. 267)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With k' &gt; k, the new price P₀' &lt; P₀. Dividend policy affects share price.</p>
<h3>The Theoretical Argument: Why k Increases with Retention (pp. 268-269)</h3>
<p>Gordon's two key propositions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(1) investors have an aversion to risk or uncertainty, and (2) given the riskiness of a corporation, the uncertainty of a dividend it is expected to pay increases with the time in the future of the dividend&quot; (p. 269)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;an investor may be represented as discounting the dividend expected in period t at a rate of k_t, with k_t not independent of t... if aversion to risk is large enough and/or risk increases rapidly enough with time, k_t increases with t.&quot; (p. 268)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The single discount rate k in the Gordon Growth Model is an AVERAGE of the time-varying k_t rates, weighted by the dividend V₀. Lowering near dividends and raising distant dividends shifts weight toward the higher k_t values, raising the average k, and lowering P₀.</p>
<h3>MM's Criticisms Addressed (p. 269)</h3>
<p>Gordon responds to two specific MM criticisms:</p>
<p><strong>1. &quot;Purely subjective discount rate&quot; criticism:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;First, they differentiated between my 'purely subjective discount rate and the objective market-given yields' and stated: 'To attempt to derive valuation formulas from these purely subjective discount factors involves, of course, an error.' My assumptions and empirical results may be questioned, but where is the error?&quot; (p. 269)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. &quot;Higher returns would follow&quot; criticism:</strong>
MM argued that if investors paid a premium for high dividends, low-payout holders would earn consistently higher returns. Gordon responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;two shares cannot sell at different yields regardless of how much they differ in risk because the holders of the higher-yield share would 'actually realize consistently higher returns over any stated interval of time.' Do MM deny that investors have an aversion to risk?&quot; (p. 269)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Empirical Model (pp. 270-271)</h3>
<p>Under assumptions that the firm (1) retains fraction b of income, (2) earns rate r on reinvested equity, (3) maintains its debt-equity ratio, and (4) undertakes no new outside equity financing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = (1-b)Y₀/(k-br) (equation 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When k is independent of b (MM's assumption), ∂P/∂b = 0 — price is independent of dividends. Gordon tested this and &quot;obtained poor results.&quot;</p>
<p>When k is an increasing function of br (Gordon's assumption):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = A₀[(1-b)Y₀][1+br]^α₂ (equation 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A₀ = represents valuation of all variables other than dividend and growth</li>
<li>(1-b)Y₀ = current dividend</li>
<li>br = growth rate</li>
<li>α₂ = how much investors pay for growth (positive, but limited by increasing uncertainty)</li>
</ul>
<p>When b = .8, P₀ is 8 × A₀ of Y₀. As b increases, the dividend (1-b)Y₀ falls and br rises — whether P₀ rises or falls depends on α₂ and r (profitability of investment).</p>
<h3>The Extraordinary Closing: Practitioners vs. Academics (p. 272)</h3>
<p>Gordon's conclusion identifies the exact divide the maxEPS paradigm paper documents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In both camps, optimal policy is taken as the policy that maximizes the value of the corporation. Although corporations may not make investment and financing decisions with only this objective in mind, managements are certainly not indifferent to the prices at which their corporations' securities sell. Hence the policy question posed has practical significance.&quot; (p. 272)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In one camp, where we find MM, it is argued that a corporation's cost of capital is a constant — i.e., independent of the method and level of financing. Optimal policy is the investment that equates the marginal return on investment with this cost of capital. The inescapable conclusion is that financing policy is not a problem.&quot; (p. 272)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The opposite position is that a corporation's cost of capital varies with the method and level of financing. My judgment is that the theoretical and empirical evidence we have favors this position.&quot; (p. 272)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the devastating sociological observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For a long time the position that cost of capital is a constant was held almost exclusively by economists, who were sophisticated in methods of theoretical and econometric analysis but knew little of finance. By contrast, the position that the cost of capital is a variable was held by finance men, who were familiar with their subject but not with advanced methods of theoretical and empirical research. People in each group talked only to those who agreed with them, and in consequence not much was said.&quot; (p. 272)</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Practitioner vs. Academic Divide — Stated Explicitly</h3>
<p>Gordon's closing passage (p. 272) is a perfect encapsulation of the two-paradigm divide. The academics (MM) said cost of capital is a constant; the practitioners said it's a variable. The academics had mathematical sophistication; the practitioners had empirical knowledge. Gordon, remarkably, is an academic who sides with the practitioners.</p>
<h3>2. Dividend Policy Matters Because k Depends on Payout</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, the P/E ratio depends on (among other things) the payout ratio — exactly Gordon's point. If managers cut dividends to fund investment, the P/E may fall (k rises), offsetting the earnings benefit of investment. EPS-maximizing managers must consider the P/E impact of retention, not just the EPS impact.</p>
<h3>3. The Cost of Capital as a Variable = Earnings Yield Is Observable</h3>
<p>If the cost of capital varies with financial policy (Gordon's position), then it cannot be determined from a theoretical model alone — it must be observed from the market. The earnings yield is the observable cost of equity. This supports the EPS paradigm's use of the earnings yield as the market price of equity capital.</p>
<h3>4. The Model Includes Both Dividends AND Growth</h3>
<p>Gordon's equation (8) — P₀ = A₀[(1-b)Y₀][1+br]^α₂ — shows price as a function of current dividend AND growth. This is more nuanced than P = E/k but still earnings-based. The EPS paradigm can accommodate this: the P/E ratio is a function of the growth rate and payout ratio, both of which are earnings-based variables.</p>
<h3>5. Gordon vs. MM Is the Pre-History of the EPS Paradigm Debate</h3>
<p>The Gordon-MM dividend debate (1959-1963) is a precursor to the broader EPS vs. NPV paradigm debate. Gordon argues from empirical evidence and practitioner intuition; MM argue from theoretical logic. Gordon's model (P = f(dividends, growth)) is earnings-based; MM's model (P = PV of cash flows, independent of dividend policy) is cash-flow-based.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Gordon (1959)</strong> — The earlier RES paper provides the empirical evidence; this JF paper provides the theoretical argument and responds to MM's criticisms.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — MM's dividend irrelevance paper is the direct target. Gordon accepts MM's proof under certainty but rejects the extension to uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon was a discussant at this AFA session. His book mediates between Gordon and MM, concluding that the traditional view on both dividends and leverage is &quot;very like&quot; the empirically correct answer.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — Lintner was also a discussant. His dividend smoothing model shows that managers behave AS IF dividends matter — exactly Gordon's position.</li>
<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — Williams's &quot;a stock is worth the present value of all its future dividends&quot; is the foundation for Gordon's argument that the certainty of dividends matters.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1959)</strong> — Durand's critique of MM on leverage parallels Gordon's critique on dividends: the theory is logically valid but empirically inapplicable.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Gordon's p. 272 passage (&quot;economists... who knew little of finance&quot; vs. &quot;finance men... who were familiar with their subject&quot;) directly supports the paradigm paper's narrative of two camps talking past each other.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — Gordon's model (P₀ = f(dividend, growth)) provides the theoretical framework for how the P/E ratio depends on payout policy. EPS-maximizing managers must jointly optimize EPS and the P/E ratio, which Gordon's model describes.</li>
