    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Jensen's 1986 <em>American Economic Review</em> (Papers &amp; Proceedings) paper introduces the &quot;free cash flow hypothesis&quot;: managers of firms with substantial free cash flow (FCF) — cash flow in excess of that required to fund all positive-NPV projects — have incentives to waste it on empire-building, value-destroying acquisitions, and organizational inefficiency rather than returning it to shareholders. Debt serves as a disciplinary device: by committing the firm to make interest and principal payments, debt forces managers to disgorge cash rather than waste it. The theory explains (1) why leverage-increasing transactions (debt-for-equity swaps, stock repurchases funded by debt, LBOs) increase firm value while leverage-decreasing transactions destroy it, (2) why &quot;diversification&quot; programs tend to destroy value, (3) why LBO targets are typically mature firms with stable cash flows and low growth, (4) why the oil industry's excess E&amp;D spending after the 1970s price shocks was value-destroying, and (5) why takeovers serve as an external governance mechanism when internal controls fail. For the EPS project, this paper is the canonical NPV-paradigm explanation for debt as a governance tool — the foil to the EPS paradigm's simpler explanation that debt boosts EPS when the earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section I: The Role of Debt in Motivating Organizational Efficiency (pp. 323-325)</h3>
<p><strong>The core problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Managers are agents of shareholders with conflicting interests</li>
<li>Managers have incentives to grow the firm beyond its optimal size: growth increases resources under management, managers' power, and their compensation (which is positively related to growth)</li>
<li>Competition in product and factor markets disciplines firms in activities where competitive forces are strong, but in activities generating substantial economic rents or quasi rents, internal controls and the market for corporate control are more important</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Free cash flow defined:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Free cash flow is cash flow in excess of that required to fund all projects that have positive net present values when discounted at the relevant cost of capital.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The agency conflict:</strong> When FCF is large, the conflict between shareholders and managers over payout is severe. Managers want to retain and invest (even in negative-NPV projects); shareholders want distributions.</p>
<p><strong>The &quot;control hypothesis&quot; for debt creation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Debt forces managers to pay out cash (interest and principal) rather than waste it</li>
<li>Debt is an effective substitute for dividends because dividend promises are weak (can be reduced), while debt obligations are binding (backed by bankruptcy)</li>
<li>By issuing debt to buy back stock or exchange for equity, firms create organizational incentives to disgorge cash and motivate efficiency</li>
<li>The threat of failure to make debt service payments serves as an effective motivating force</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Costs of increased leverage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agency costs of debt rise with leverage (moral hazard, monitoring costs, bankruptcy costs)</li>
<li>Optimal debt-equity ratio is where firm value is maximized — marginal costs of debt just offset marginal benefits</li>
<li>The control effects will NOT be important for rapidly growing firms with large profitable investment projects but no FCF — these firms need to go to capital markets regularly, which provides external monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section II: Evidence from Financial Restructuring (pp. 325)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leverage-increasing transactions (stock repurchases, debt-for-equity exchanges) produce significantly POSITIVE stock price reactions (2-day gains range from 2.2% to 21.9%)</li>
<li>Leverage-decreasing transactions (equity-for-debt exchanges, convertible calls) produce significantly NEGATIVE reactions (2-day losses from -0.4% to -9.9%)</li>
<li>Targeted repurchases (greenmail) and preferred stock sales are exceptions — these bring cash UNDER managerial control, consistent with FCF theory</li>
<li>Value change magnitudes are related to the tightness of the commitment bonding of future cash flows</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section III: Evidence from LBOs (pp. 325-326)</h3>
<ul>
<li>LBO targets are typically divisions of larger firms or entire firms that have stable business histories, low growth prospects, and substantial free cash flow</li>
<li>LBO premiums average over 50%, indicating massive prior value destruction from FCF waste</li>
<li>LBO financing uses 10:1 debt-to-equity ratios, sometimes higher</li>
<li>Strip financing (holding proportional strips of all securities) eliminates conflicts among claimants and makes reorganization easier if needed</li>
<li>Top-level managers receive 15-20% equity stakes, aligning incentives</li>
<li>The LBO organizational form &quot;competes successfully with the open corporate form because of advantages in controlling the agency costs of free cash flow&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section IV: Evidence from the Oil Industry (pp. 326-327)</h3>
<p>Jensen's centerpiece case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the 1973 oil price increase, the industry generated massive FCF</li>
<li>Oil prices increased tenfold from 1973 to late 1970s</li>
<li>As consumption fell and future price expectations declined, optimal capacity shrank</li>
<li>But industry continued spending heavily on E&amp;D even as returns fell below cost of capital</li>
<li>Oil firms ALSO launched diversification programs outside the industry (Exxon → office equipment, Sohio → mining, Amoco → mining) — all value-destroying</li>
<li>McConnell &amp; Muscarella (1986): E&amp;D expenditure announcements 1975-81 were associated with stock price DECREASES — the opposite of what happens with industrial R&amp;D</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimates of the present value of future net cash flows from E&amp;D &quot;ranged from less than 60 to 90 cents on every dollar invested in these activities.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Section V: Takeovers in the Oil Industry (pp. 327-328)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Merger wave in oil was driven by the need to reduce excess capacity</li>
<li>Takeover attempts can generate the crisis needed to force retrenchment that management resists</li>
<li>Mesa Petroleum's activities led firms to merge, take on debt, reduce E&amp;D, and return cash to shareholders</li>
<li>Total gains to shareholders in Gulf/Chevron, Getty/Texaco, Dupont/Conoco mergers exceeded $17 billion</li>
<li>Diamond Shamrock's market value FELL 2% on restructuring announcement — because the restructuring REDUCED cash dividends</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section VI: Free Cash Flow Theory of Takeovers (pp. 328-329)</h3>
<p><strong>Predictions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Debt creation in takeovers increases efficiency by forcing cash payout</li>
<li>Takeovers are more likely in industries with large cash flows and few growth opportunities (oil, tobacco, forest products, food, broadcasting)</li>
<li>Value-destroying mergers are more likely from firms with unused borrowing power and large FCF</li>
<li>Diversification programs generally destroy value</li>
<li>Bidders with large FCF will tend to make worse acquisitions</li>
<li>Cash-financed acquisitions involve payout to target shareholders; stock-financed do not — so cash mergers should create more value</li>
<li>Targets with good performance prior to takeover will be of two types: firms with poor management AND firms with high FCF that refuse to pay out</li>
</ol>
<h3>Jensen's Overall Assessment (p. 329)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The agency cost of free cash flow is consistent with a wide range of data for which there has been no consistent explanation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Jensen's Theory Is the Canonical NPV-Paradigm Explanation for Debt</h3>
<p>In the NPV paradigm, debt needs a REASON to exist (MM irrelevance is the starting point). Jensen provides one: agency costs of free cash flow. Managers waste FCF, so debt disciplines them by committing the cash. This is fundamentally a friction-based explanation — debt is valuable only because of the agency problem. In the EPS paradigm, debt needs no friction to justify it: firms lever up when the borrowing rate is below the earnings yield because doing so boosts EPS.</p>
<h3>2. The EPS Paradigm Generates the Same Predictions Without Frictions</h3>
<p>Jensen's predictions — leverage increases boost stock prices, firms with high FCF and low growth should have more debt, LBO targets are mature cash-generating firms — all follow from the EPS paradigm without any agency costs. Mature firms with high FCF have high earnings and high earnings yields. With high earnings yields, debt-financed repurchases are highly EPS-accretive. These firms lever up not to discipline managers but to boost EPS. The observable patterns are identical; the mechanism is different.</p>
<h3>3. &quot;Free Cash Flow&quot; Maps onto &quot;Earnings Available for Distribution&quot;</h3>
<p>Jensen defines FCF as cash flow after all positive-NPV projects. In the EPS paradigm, the analogous concept is earnings not reinvested at returns exceeding the earnings yield. When the firm has earnings that cannot be reinvested at the earnings yield, the EPS-maximizing action is to repurchase shares (boosting EPS by retiring shares at the earnings yield) — exactly what Jensen prescribes, but for a different reason.</p>
<h3>4. Jensen Dismisses &quot;Managerial&quot; Theories — But EPS IS the Managerial Theory</h3>
<p>Myers (1984) footnote 1 lists &quot;managerial&quot; theories as a separate strand. Jensen focuses on shareholders' interests being served by debt. The EPS paradigm IS the managerial theory Jensen dismisses: managers maximize their own objective (EPS, which drives their compensation, prestige, and career outcomes), and this happens to produce debt creation not as a disciplinary tool but as an EPS-boosting tool.</p>
<h3>5. The Oil Industry Case Is EPS-Consistent</h3>
<p>Jensen's oil industry evidence — firms continuing to invest in E&amp;D despite below-cost-of-capital returns — is the EPS paradigm's capital budgeting distortion. If the return on E&amp;D exceeds the earnings yield (because oil firms had low P/E ratios reflecting depressed expectations), then E&amp;D spending is EPS-accretive even if NPV-negative. The EPS paradigm predicts that firms with low earnings yields invest in marginal projects because those projects boost EPS.</p>
<h3>6. Debt-for-Equity Swaps Boost EPS Directly</h3>
<p>Jensen explains positive stock reactions to leverage-increasing transactions via the control hypothesis. The EPS paradigm explains them directly: replacing equity with debt boosts EPS when the earnings yield exceeds the after-tax borrowing cost. The stock price rises because EPS rises, and the market capitalizes EPS. No agency cost story is needed.</p>
<h3>7. &quot;Diversification Programs Destroy Value&quot; — Or Destroy EPS?</h3>
<p>Jensen argues diversification programs are empire-building that wastes FCF. The EPS paradigm offers a complementary explanation: diversification into lower-return businesses dilutes EPS. The market responds negatively because EPS dilution signals lower future earnings per share, not because of abstract agency costs.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — MM irrelevance is the starting point. Jensen's free cash flow theory explains why debt is valuable despite (or because of) MM.</li>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — &quot;Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure.&quot; The theoretical foundation for Jensen's agency cost framework.</li>
<li><strong>Myers (1984)</strong> — &quot;The Capital Structure Puzzle.&quot; Myers proposes the pecking order as an alternative to the trade-off model. Jensen's FCF theory is a third alternative: debt as a control mechanism, not just a tax shield or information device.</li>
<li><strong>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984)</strong> — The pecking order model. Jensen's theory provides a different reason for the same preference for internal funds: managers prefer internal funds because external monitoring is costly to them.</li>
<li><strong>Donaldson (1961, 1969)</strong> — <em>Corporate Debt Capacity</em> and <em>Strategy for Financial Mobility</em>. Donaldson documented that managers prefer internal finance and avoid external markets — exactly the behavior Jensen's theory predicts (managers want to avoid discipline).</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (2002)</strong> — Confirm the negative profitability-leverage relation. Jensen's theory predicts the OPPOSITE: profitable firms with high FCF should have MORE debt (to control agency costs). This is one of the trade-off model's failures.</li>
<li><strong>Frank &amp; Goyal (2009)</strong> — Profitability's negative sign is the one core factor inconsistent with both trade-off theory (including Jensen's variant). Jensen's FCF hypothesis actually strengthens the prediction of MORE debt for profitable firms, making the empirical failure worse.</li>
<li><strong>DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo (2006)</strong> — Argue payout matters even without frictions. Jensen's theory requires agency costs for payout to matter; DeAngelo &amp; DeAngelo show it matters even without them.</li>
<li><strong>Grullon &amp; Michaely (2002)</strong> — Document substitution from dividends to repurchases. In Jensen's framework, repurchases are a form of FCF payout. The shift from dividends to repurchases may reflect the stronger commitment of repurchases (once announced) and their EPS-boosting properties.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Jensen's FCF theory is the primary foil for the EPS paradigm's capital structure predictions. Both predict debt creation by mature, profitable firms — Jensen via agency cost control, the EPS paradigm via EPS accretion. The empirical tests in the EPS paper should distinguish: Jensen predicts firms WITH governance problems should lever up more; the EPS paradigm predicts firms with HIGHER earnings yields (relative to borrowing costs) lever up more, regardless of governance.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Jensen (1986) is a key part of the &quot;stone soup&quot; critique: the NPV paradigm needed to add agency costs as yet another friction to explain debt. The EPS paradigm generates the same prediction (debt for mature firms) from the objective function alone, without any friction.</li>
