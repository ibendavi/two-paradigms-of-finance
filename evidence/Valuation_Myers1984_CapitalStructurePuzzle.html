    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Myers's 1984 AFA Presidential Address is the most candid admission by a leading finance theorist that capital structure theory has failed to explain actual corporate behavior. Opening with &quot;How do firms choose their capital structures? Again, the answer is, 'We don't know,'&quot; Myers contrasts two frameworks — the static tradeoff theory (firms target an optimal debt ratio balancing tax shields against distress costs) and the pecking order theory (firms prefer internal finance, then debt, then equity as last resort). His verdict: the static tradeoff has &quot;an unacceptably low R²&quot; in explaining actual leverage, while the pecking order — which Dean (1951) and Donaldson (1961) documented as simple observation — fits the facts better. For the EPS project, this paper is critical because (1) Myers explicitly excludes &quot;managerial&quot; theories from consideration (p. 3), creating the theoretical blind spot that the EPS paradigm fills; (2) he documents five &quot;facts&quot; about financing behavior that the EPS paradigm explains naturally; (3) he acknowledges Miller's &quot;neutral mutation&quot; hypothesis — that financing patterns may have no effect on value and therefore explain nothing important — which is precisely the view the EPS paradigm challenges.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Opening Confession (pp. 1-2)</h3>
<p>Myers frames his address by echoing Fischer Black's &quot;Dividend Puzzle&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper's title is intended to remind you of Fischer Black's well-known note on 'The Dividend Puzzle,' which he closed by saying, 'What should the corporation do about dividend policy? We don't know.' I will start by asking, 'How do firms choose their capital structures?' Again, the answer is, 'We don't know.'&quot; (p. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The capital structure puzzle is tougher than the dividend one. We know quite a bit about dividend policy. John Lintner's model of how firms set dividends dates back to 1956, and it still seems to work.&quot; (p. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Excluding &quot;Managerial&quot; Theories (p. 3)</h3>
<p>Myers makes an explicit choice to exclude the EPS paradigm's framework:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have arbitrarily, and probably unfairly, excluded 'managerial' theories which might explain firms' capital structure choices. I have chosen not to consider models which cut the umbilical cord that ties managers' acts to stockholders' interests.&quot; (p. 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This single sentence creates the theoretical blind spot that the EPS paradigm fills. By excluding managerial objectives, Myers constrains himself to theories where managers maximize shareholder value — and then finds that these theories don't explain what firms actually do.</p>
<h3>Miller's &quot;Neutral Mutation&quot; Hypothesis (pp. 3-4)</h3>
<p>Myers introduces Miller's idea that financing patterns may be evolutionary accidents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He suggests that firms fall into some financing patterns or habits which have no material effect on firm value. The habits may make managers feel better, and since they do no harm, no one cares to stop or change them. Thus someone who identifies these habits and uses them to predict financing behavior would not be explaining anything important.&quot; (p. 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The neutral mutations idea is important as a warning. Given time and imagination, economists can usually invent some model that assigns apparent economic rationality to any random event.&quot; (pp. 3-4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EPS paradigm directly challenges this: EPS maximization is NOT a neutral mutation — it is an alternative objective function that generates specific, testable predictions about leverage, payout, and investment that differ from NPV maximization.</p>
<h3>The Static Tradeoff Hypothesis (pp. 4-9)</h3>
<p>The firm balances tax shields against costs of financial distress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A firm's optimal debt ratio is usually viewed as determined by a tradeoff of the costs and benefits of borrowing, holding the firm's assets and investment plans constant.&quot; (p. 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problems with the static tradeoff:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjustment costs are a cop-out</strong> (p. 5): &quot;there is nothing in the usual static tradeoff stories suggesting that adjustment costs are a first-order concern — in fact, they are rarely mentioned. Invoking them without modelling them is a cop-out.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-sectional dispersion is too large</strong> (pp. 5-6): &quot;I find it hard to understand the observed diversity of capital structures across firms that seem similar in a static tradeoff framework.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax effects are ambiguous</strong> (pp. 6-8): With different marginal tax rates across firms, the tax advantage varies from 46 cents on the dollar to near zero. &quot;I know of no study clearly demonstrating that a firm's tax status has predictable, material effects on its debt policy.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highly profitable firms borrow LEAST</strong> — the most devastating empirical fact (implied throughout): the tradeoff theory predicts profitable firms should borrow more (they have more income to shield), but in reality they borrow less.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Pecking Order Theory (pp. 9-16)</h3>
<p>Myers presents the pecking order as the alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. Firms prefer internal finance.&quot;
&quot;2. They adapt their target dividend payout ratios to their investment opportunities.&quot;
&quot;3. Sticky dividend policies, plus unpredictable fluctuations in profitability and investment opportunities, mean that internally-generated cash flow may be more or less than investment outlays.&quot;
&quot;4. If external finance is required, firms issue the safest security first.&quot; (pp. 9-10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The pecking order literature (pp. 10-11):</strong></p>
<p>Myers cites Donaldson (1961) as the key empirical source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it comes through loud and clear in Donaldson's 1961 study of the financing practices of a sample of large corporations. He observed that 'Management strongly favored internal generation as a source of new funds even to the exclusion of external funds except for occasional unavoidable bulges in the need for funds.' These bulges were not generally met by cutting dividends: 'Reducing the customary cash dividend payment... was unthinkable to most managements except as a defensive measure in a period of extreme financial distress.'&quot; (p. 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the remarkable Price-Earnings ratio passage from Donaldson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;'Though few companies would go so far as to rule out a sale of common under any circumstances, the large majority had not had such a sale in the past 20 years and did not anticipate one in the foreseeable future. This was particularly remarkable in view of the very high Price-Earnings ratios of recent years. Several financial officers showed that they were well aware that this had been a good time to sell common, but the reluctance still persisted.'&quot; (p. 10, quoting Donaldson pp. 57-58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the EPS paradigm in action: even when P/E ratios were high (meaning the cost of equity was LOW), firms refused to issue stock. In the NPV paradigm, this is irrational — cheap equity should be issued. In the EPS paradigm, issuing stock DILUTES EPS, which managers refuse to do regardless of the P/E.</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetric information foundation (pp. 11-16):</strong></p>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984) provide the theoretical justification: if managers know more than investors, issuing equity signals overvaluation, so the market penalizes stock issues. This generates:</p>
<ol>
<li>A cost of external financing (beyond transaction costs)</li>
<li>A preference for debt over equity (debt is less information-sensitive)</li>
</ol>
<p>The manager issues equity only when y ≥ ΔN (project NPV ≥ dilution from undervalued shares).</p>
<h3>Five Facts About Financing Behavior (pp. 16-22)</h3>
<p><strong>Fact 1: Internal vs. external equity (p. 16)</strong>
Aggregate investment is financed by debt issues and internal funds. &quot;Net new stock issues were never more than 6 percent of external financing.&quot; Both theories can explain this, though the mechanisms differ.</p>
<p><strong>Fact 2: Timing of security issues (p. 17)</strong>
&quot;Firms apparently try to 'time' stock issues when security prices are 'high.'&quot; After stock prices have risen, firms are more likely to issue stock than debt. Myers notes this is &quot;embarrassing to static tradeoff advocates&quot; (if value rises, debt ratio falls, firm should issue DEBT to rebalance) and &quot;equally embarrassing to the pecking order hypothesis.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Fact 3: Borrowing against intangibles (pp. 18-19)</strong>
&quot;Firms holding valuable intangible assets or growth opportunities tend to borrow less than firms holding mostly tangible assets.&quot; This is consistent with both theories but more naturally explained by pecking order (intangible assets can't be used as collateral).</p>
<p><strong>Fact 4: Exchange offers (pp. 19-20)</strong>
Debt-for-equity exchanges are good news; equity-for-debt are bad news. Static tradeoff predicts exchanges should be neutral if both directions move toward the optimum. Pecking order explains this via signaling.</p>
<p><strong>Fact 5: Issue vs. repurchase of shares (pp. 20-21)</strong>
Stock issues cause price drops; repurchases cause price increases. Consistent with pecking order (issue = bad signal; repurchase = good signal).</p>
<h3>Conclusion: The &quot;Modified Pecking Order&quot; (pp. 22-24)</h3>
<p>Myers's verdict on the tradeoff theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The static tradeoff story works to some extent, but it seems to have an unacceptably low R². Actual debt ratios vary widely across apparently similar firms.&quot; (p. 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His preferred model — the &quot;modified pecking order&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. Firms have good reasons to avoid having to finance real investment by issuing common stock or other risky securities. They do not want to run the risk of falling into the dilemma of either passing by positive-NPV projects or issuing stock at a price they think is too low.&quot;
&quot;2. They set target dividend payout ratios so that normal rates of equity investment can be met by internally generated funds.&quot;
&quot;3. The firm may also plan to cover part of normal investment outlays with new borrowing, but it tries to restrain itself enough to keep the debt safe.&quot;
&quot;4. Since target dividend payout ratios are sticky, and investment opportunities fluctuate relative to internal cash flow, the firm will from time to time exhaust its ability to issue safe debt.&quot; (pp. 23-24)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The crucial difference between this and the static tradeoff story is that, in the modified pecking order story, observed debt ratios will reflect the cumulative requirement for external financing — a requirement cumulated over an extended period.&quot; (p. 24)</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Myers Explicitly Excludes the EPS Paradigm — And Then Fails to Explain Behavior</h3>
<p>Myers's most important sentence for the EPS project: &quot;I have arbitrarily, and probably unfairly, excluded 'managerial' theories which might explain firms' capital structure choices&quot; (p. 3). He then spends 22 pages showing that value-maximizing theories fail. The EPS paradigm IS the &quot;managerial&quot; theory he excluded — and it explains precisely the patterns he documents.</p>
<h3>2. The Five Facts Are EPS Paradigm Predictions</h3>
<p>Every one of Myers's five facts about financing behavior is predicted by the EPS paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal &gt; external finance</strong>: Internal funds don't dilute EPS; equity issuance does.</li>
<li><strong>Timing of stock issues</strong>: Firms issue stock when P/E is high because dilution per share is minimized.</li>
<li><strong>Tangible firms borrow more</strong>: Value firms (low P/E, high earnings yield) have a larger EY-borrowing rate spread, making leverage more EPS-accretive.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-for-equity is good news</strong>: It boosts EPS (fewer shares, lower after-tax cost) = market applauds.</li>
<li><strong>Repurchases are good news</strong>: Retiring shares at the earnings yield directly boosts EPS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Donaldson's P/E Passage Is the EPS Paradigm in Action</h3>
<p>The Donaldson quote about firms refusing to issue stock &quot;in view of the very high Price-Earnings ratios&quot; is devastating for NPV theory (cheap equity should be used) but perfectly consistent with EPS maximization: managers won't issue stock because new shares dilute EPS, regardless of the P/E. In fact, a HIGH P/E makes each new share more expensive in EPS terms (each new share claims a larger slice of earnings relative to what the firm receives).</p>
<h3>4. The &quot;Neutral Mutation&quot; Challenge</h3>
<p>Miller's suggestion that financing patterns are evolutionary accidents that &quot;have no material effect on firm value&quot; is the null hypothesis the EPS paradigm must reject. The EPS paradigm claims that financing patterns DO matter — not for firm value (which may indeed be unaffected under efficient pricing) but for EPS, which is the metric managers actually optimize.</p>
<h3>5. The Static Tradeoff's &quot;Low R²&quot; = NPV Paradigm Failure</h3>
<p>Myers's admission that the tradeoff theory has an &quot;unacceptably low R²&quot; is an admission that the NPV paradigm's capital structure theory doesn't work. The EPS paradigm offers an alternative explanation: firms choose leverage based on the earnings yield / borrowing rate spread, not based on the tax-shield / distress-cost tradeoff.</p>
<h3>6. &quot;Highly Profitable Firms Borrow Less&quot; — The Pecking Order or EPS?</h3>
<p>The most puzzling fact for the tradeoff theory — profitable firms use less debt — is naturally explained by the EPS paradigm: profitable firms have high EPS already and don't need leverage to boost it. They also have abundant internal funds (high earnings = high cash flow), so the pecking order applies. Both the pecking order and the EPS paradigm explain this fact; the tradeoff theory cannot.</p>
