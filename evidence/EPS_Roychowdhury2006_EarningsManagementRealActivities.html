    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Roychowdhury's 2006 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper provides the first large-sample evidence that firms manage earnings through REAL business activities -- not just accounting accruals -- to avoid reporting annual losses. Using COMPUSTAT data from 1987-2001 (21,758 firm-years), Roychowdhury shows that &quot;suspect&quot; firm-years (firms with small positive earnings, just above zero) exhibit three patterns of real activities manipulation: (1) abnormally low cash flow from operations (abnormal CFO = -0.0200, t=-3.05), consistent with price discounts to accelerate sales; (2) abnormally low discretionary expenditures -- R&amp;D, advertising, and SG&amp;A (abnormal DISEXP = -0.0591, t=-4.35); and (3) abnormally high production costs (abnormal PROD = +0.0497, t=4.99), consistent with overproduction to spread fixed costs across more units and reduce per-unit COGS. Cross-sectional tests show that real activities manipulation is MORE prevalent in manufacturing firms, firms with debt, firms with high market-to-book ratios, and firms with high inventories/receivables -- but LESS prevalent in firms with high institutional ownership. The institutional ownership finding (INST_RANK x SUSPECT_NI coefficient on abnormal production costs = -0.0524, t=-5.72) suggests that sophisticated investors constrain real earnings management. Results extend to firms that just beat analyst EPS forecasts by one cent: these firms also show significantly abnormal CFO (-0.0066, t=-2.39), discretionary expenses (-0.0166, t=-2.09), and production costs (+0.0076, t=2.10). For the EPS project, this paper demonstrates that the EPS objective function is powerful enough to cause firms to alter REAL business operations -- cutting R&amp;D, overproducing inventory, offering price discounts -- not merely to adjust accounting entries but to actually change economic activity to hit earnings targets.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: The Three Channels of Real Activities Manipulation (pp. 335-340)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> &quot;Real activities manipulation is defined as management actions that deviate from normal business practices, undertaken with the primary objective of meeting certain earnings thresholds&quot; (p. 336).</p>
<p><strong>Three specific methods:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sales manipulation via price discounts or lenient credit terms.</strong> This temporarily boosts sales and current-period earnings but generates abnormally low cash flow per dollar of sales (because price discounts reduce margins, and credit sales generate receivables not cash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overproduction to reduce COGS.</strong> By producing more units than needed, manufacturing firms spread fixed overhead costs across more units, reducing per-unit cost of goods sold. This raises reported earnings but generates abnormally high total production costs (since the excess units are added to inventory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduction of discretionary expenditures.</strong> Cutting R&amp;D, advertising, and SG&amp;A expenses directly increases current earnings. When these expenses are paid in cash, the reduction also boosts CFO.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why real over accruals?</strong> Roychowdhury argues that post-Sarbanes-Oxley scrutiny of accruals makes real activities manipulation more attractive: &quot;Given that accrual-based earnings management is more likely to draw auditor or regulatory scrutiny than real decisions about pricing and production, managers have recently been constrained in their ability to manage accruals&quot; (p. 337).</p>
<h3>Section 3: Suspect Firm-Years and the Zero Threshold (pp. 340-345)</h3>
<p><strong>Identifying targets:</strong> Following Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997), Roychowdhury uses the discontinuity in the distribution of earnings at zero. &quot;Suspect&quot; firm-years have income before extraordinary items (IBEI) scaled by total assets between 0 and 0.005 -- the &quot;just above zero&quot; interval.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Histogram of earnings intervals shows the well-known discontinuity: an unusually high frequency of firm-years just ABOVE zero and an unusually low frequency just BELOW zero. The excess probability at the suspect interval is the signature of earnings management.</p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> COMPUSTAT 1987-2001, 4,252 firms, 21,758 firm-years (for the main analysis). Industries defined at two-digit SIC level (36 industries, minimum 15 observations per industry-year).</p>
<h3>Section 4: Main Results (Tables 4-5, Figures 2-4)</h3>
<p><strong>Estimation models (from Dechow, Kothari &amp; Watts 1998):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normal CFO: CFO/A = f(1/A, S/A, dS/A)</li>
<li>Normal production costs: PROD/A = f(1/A, S/A, dS/A, dS_{t-1}/A)</li>
<li>Normal discretionary expenses: DISEXP/A = f(1/A, S_{t-1}/A)</li>
</ul>
<p>All estimated as annual industry-year cross-sectional regressions. Residuals are &quot;abnormal&quot; components. Model R-squared: 0.45 for CFO, 0.89 for production costs, 0.38 for discretionary expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Figures 2-4:</strong> Plot residuals by earnings interval. Abnormal production costs show a SPIKE at the suspect interval (just above zero). Abnormal CFO shows the most negative value at the suspect interval. Abnormal discretionary expenses also most negative near zero.</p>

<p><strong>The institutional ownership result (H8A) is the most important for the EPS project.</strong> Firms with above-median institutional ownership exhibit LESS real activities manipulation. The coefficient on INST_RANK x SUSPECT_NI is +0.0631 (t=6.38) for discretionary expenses (they cut LESS) and -0.0524 (t=-5.72) for production costs (they overproduce LESS). &quot;There is consistent and statistically strong evidence of a negative correlation between the measures of real activities manipulation and institutional ownership&quot; (p. 359).</p>
<p><strong>Debt as amplifier (H4A):</strong> Firms with debt outstanding manipulate MORE. Coefficient on HASDEBT x SUSPECT_NI: -0.0765 (t=-3.98) for discretionary expenses, +0.0261 (t=2.21) for production costs. Debt covenants create additional incentive to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Section 5.4: Performance Matching (Table 8)</h3>
<p><strong>Robustness test (Kothari, Leone &amp; Wasley 2005 method):</strong> Each firm-year is matched to the firm in its industry with the closest net income/assets ratio in the prior year. Abnormal variables are computed in EXCESS of the match. Results are robust:</p>

<h3>Section 5.5: Analyst Forecast Tests (Table 9)</h3>
<p><strong>Extending to EPS benchmarks:</strong> Firms that just beat the annual analyst consensus EPS forecast by one cent (SUSPECT_FE = 1) also exhibit real activities manipulation. Sample: 11,640 firm-years with I/B/E/S coverage, 1,352 suspect (866 unique firms).</p>

<p>&quot;The stronger results obtained when using forecast errors with respect to the final consensus suggest the possibility that managers manipulate real activities during the year to meet their expectations of the final consensus forecast&quot; (p. 364).</p>
<h3>Section 6: Conclusion (pp. 364-365)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper complements the existing literature on earnings management in several ways. First, this study develops empirical methods to detect real activities manipulation in large samples. In prior literature on real activities manipulation, the focus has mostly been limited to the reduction of discretionary expenditures. Second, the paper documents evidence consistent with real activities manipulation around earnings thresholds commonly discussed in the literature, in particular, the zero threshold. Third, this paper provides insights into factors that affect the nature and extent of real activities manipulation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key open questions: (1) How do managers choose between real and accrual manipulation? (2) What is the timing within the fiscal year? (3) Does the stock market understand the current and future implications of real activities manipulation?</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The EPS Objective Function Drives REAL Economic Activity</h3>
<p>This is the most important finding for the EPS project. Managers don't just adjust accounting numbers to hit earnings targets -- they change actual business operations: cutting R&amp;D, overproducing inventory, offering price discounts. The EPS objective function is powerful enough to alter the REAL economy, not just its measurement. This goes beyond &quot;earnings management&quot; into what Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016) call &quot;the real effects&quot; -- EPS maximization shapes investment, production, and pricing decisions.</p>
<h3>2. Three Specific Mechanisms Connect EPS to Real Decisions</h3>
<p>The three channels -- (1) sales acceleration via discounts, (2) overproduction to lower unit COGS, (3) R&amp;D/advertising/SG&amp;A cuts -- are three specific ways the EPS objective function distorts real decisions. Each represents a different dimension of corporate policy subordinated to the earnings target:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales manipulation</strong> = pricing policy driven by EPS</li>
<li><strong>Overproduction</strong> = production/inventory policy driven by EPS</li>
<li><strong>Discretionary expense cuts</strong> = R&amp;D/innovation/marketing policy driven by EPS</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. The R&amp;D Channel Connects to Almeida (2019)</h3>
<p>Roychowdhury's finding that suspect firms have abnormally low discretionary expenditures (-5.91% of assets) is the SAME phenomenon Almeida (2019) documents: firms that &quot;just meet&quot; earnings benchmarks have 2.5% lower R&amp;D and 25% more volatile R&amp;D. Roychowdhury provides the econometric framework; Almeida provides the welfare analysis.</p>
<h3>4. Institutional Ownership CONSTRAINS Real Earnings Management</h3>
<p>The finding that institutional ownership reduces real activities manipulation (INST_RANK x SUSPECT_NI significant at 1% level) creates an interesting tension for the EPS project. If sophisticated institutional investors constrain EPS-motivated real manipulation, this suggests they DON'T want managers to maximize EPS at the expense of real value. But this contradicts the &quot;two paradigm&quot; view where investors also use EPS-based pricing. One resolution: institutional investors care about EPS but prefer it to come from real performance rather than manipulation.</p>
<h3>5. Debt Amplifies Real Earnings Management</h3>
<p>Firms with debt outstanding manipulate real activities MORE aggressively to avoid losses. This connects to the EPS paradigm's capital structure predictions: the leverage created by EPS-motivated debt policy then creates additional pressure to manage earnings (to avoid covenant violations and maintain access to debt markets), reinforcing the cycle.</p>
<h3>6. Analyst Forecasts as EPS Benchmarks</h3>
<p>The extension to analyst forecast benchmarks (Table 9) directly connects real activities manipulation to the EPS objective function. The analyst consensus forecast IS the EPS target. Firms that just beat by one cent show the same patterns of manipulation -- confirming that the earnings benchmark literature is fundamentally about EPS management.</p>
<h3>7. The Post-SOX Shift from Accruals to Real Actions</h3>
<p>Roychowdhury's argument that Sarbanes-Oxley has made accrual management harder, pushing firms toward real activities manipulation, is important for the temporal evolution of the EPS paradigm. As accounting scrutiny increases, the EPS objective doesn't change -- only the method of achievement changes. This is consistent with Dichev et al.'s (2013) finding that CFOs report declining reporting discretion but persistent earnings management.</p>
<h3>8. Quantitative Magnitudes</h3>
<p>The magnitudes are economically significant: suspect firms have abnormal discretionary expenses of -5.91% of assets and abnormal production costs of +4.97% of assets. These are not trivial adjustments -- they represent substantial real resource misallocation driven by the earnings target. For a firm with $1 billion in assets, this implies ~$50-60 million in real distortions.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses.&quot; Document the discontinuity in earnings distribution at zero. Roychowdhury uses the same discontinuity to identify suspect firms and shows the manipulation is REAL, not just accrual-based.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> -- &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; Survey evidence that 80% of managers would cut discretionary spending to meet earnings targets, and 55.3% would delay a positive-NPV project. Roychowdhury provides the archival confirmation of what managers self-reported.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> -- &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show EPS-motivated repurchases crowd out real investment. Roychowdhury shows a different channel: real activities manipulation (R&amp;D cuts, overproduction) also represents real economic distortion driven by earnings targets. Together they document multiple channels through which EPS goals distort real activity.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida (2019)</strong> -- &quot;Is It Time to Get Rid of Earnings-per-Share (EPS)?&quot; Documents that &quot;just meet&quot; firms have 2.5% lower R&amp;D and 25% more volatile R&amp;D. Roychowdhury provides the econometric framework: the abnormal discretionary expenses of -5.91% for suspect firms IS the R&amp;D distortion Almeida quantifies.</li>
<li><strong>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2013)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field.&quot; CFOs acknowledge that &quot;earnings are often managed using real actions such as cutting R&amp;D, maintenance expenses and marketing expenditures&quot; and note this is &quot;harder to detect but often more damaging&quot; than accrual management. Roychowdhury provides the large-sample statistical evidence for what CFOs describe.</li>
<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> -- &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Show repurchases are used to boost EPS. Roychowdhury shows three additional real channels (price discounts, overproduction, expense cuts) -- repurchases are not the only real action taken for EPS.</li>
<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> -- &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Find repurchases offset ESO dilution. Roychowdhury's R&amp;D-cutting result may also be amplified in ESO-heavy firms: cutting R&amp;D boosts EPS, partially offsetting the dilutive effect of options.</li>
<li><strong>Dechow, Kothari &amp; Watts (1998)</strong> -- &quot;The Relation between Earnings and Cash Flows.&quot; Provide the normal-levels models that Roychowdhury uses to estimate expected CFO, production costs, and discretionary expenses. The estimation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Kothari, Leone &amp; Wasley (2005)</strong> -- &quot;Performance Matched Discretionary Accrual Measures.&quot; Provide the performance-matching methodology used in Roychowdhury's robustness tests (Table 8).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> -- Roychowdhury documents three specific real-activity channels through which the EPS objective function operates: pricing, production, and R&amp;D/marketing spending. These are additional predictions of the EPS paradigm beyond capital structure and payout: the EPS maximizer distorts product market, production, and investment decisions to hit earnings targets.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> -- The discretionary expense cuts (R&amp;D, advertising) are a form of investment distortion. Roychowdhury shows that EPS targets cause underinvestment in R&amp;D -- the same capital budgeting distortion that the EPS-and-capital-budgeting paper analyzes, but operating through the current-period budget rather than the project-selection rule.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> -- Roychowdhury's evidence strengthens the paradigm claim: if EPS maximization were just a harmless mental shortcut, firms wouldn't cut R&amp;D by 5.91% of assets to hit the target. The real activities manipulation evidence shows that EPS maximization has real economic costs -- which means it is a genuine objective function, not a reporting convention.</li>
