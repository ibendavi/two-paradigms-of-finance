    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Banz's 1981 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper documents the &quot;size effect&quot;: small NYSE firms have earned significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than large firms over a forty-year period (1936-1975). Using a generalized asset pricing model that adds market value (φ) as a second factor beyond beta, Banz finds a significantly negative size premium (γ₂ = -0.00052 monthly, t = -2.92), meaning smaller firms earn higher returns after controlling for systematic risk. The size effect is nonlinear and concentrated in the very smallest firms — there is little difference between average and large firms, but the tiniest firms earn substantially higher returns. An arbitrage portfolio (long small, short large) earns 1.52% per month (19.8% annualized) for 10-stock portfolios. Crucially, Banz himself acknowledges: &quot;it is not known whether size per se is responsible for the effect or whether size is just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors correlated with size.&quot; He also notes that Reinganum (1980) claims the P/E ratio effect is just a proxy for size. For the EPS project, this paper is essential as the foil for Basu (1983), who shows the OPPOSITE: the size effect is a proxy for the earnings yield (E/P), not vice versa.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Motivation (pp. 3-4)</h3>
<p>By the late 1970s, direct tests of the CAPM had been &quot;inconclusive,&quot; while evidence was accumulating that additional factors beyond beta might matter for asset pricing. Litzenberger &amp; Ramaswamy (1979) documented a dividend yield effect; Basu (1977) documented a P/E effect. Banz adds a third: the market value (size) of the firm.</p>
<p>The paper explicitly cites Ball (1978), who warned that &quot;anomalies&quot; like the P/E effect might be evidence of model misspecification rather than market inefficiency. Banz adopts this cautious interpretation throughout.</p>
<h3>Methodology (pp. 4-7)</h3>
<p><strong>The generalized asset pricing model:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>E(R_i) = γ₀ + γ₁β_i + γ₂[(φ_i - φ_m)/φ_m]    (Equation 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>γ₀ = expected return on a zero-beta portfolio</li>
<li>γ₁ = expected market risk premium</li>
<li>γ₂ = the &quot;size premium&quot; — the contribution of relative market value to expected returns</li>
<li>φ_i = market value (proportion) of security i</li>
<li>φ_m = average market proportion</li>
</ul>
<p>If γ₂ = 0, this reduces to the Black (1972) version of the CAPM. A negative γ₂ means small firms (φ_i &lt; φ_m) earn positive excess returns.</p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> All NYSE common stocks with at least 5 years of continuous monthly returns, 1926-1975. CRSP data. Three market indices tested: CRSP equally-weighted, CRSP value-weighted, and a comprehensive &quot;market index&quot; combining stocks, corporate bonds, and government bonds (from Ibbotson &amp; Sinquefield 1977).</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio formation:</strong> 25 portfolios sorted first by market value (5 groups), then by beta (5 groups within each size group). Betas estimated from 5-year rolling windows. Cross-sectional regression (3) estimated monthly using Fama-MacBeth (1973) methodology with GLS correction per Black &amp; Scholes (1974).</p>

<p>(Results using &quot;market index&quot; with GLS)</p>
<p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>γ₂ is significantly negative for the full period and the two 20-year subperiods</li>
<li>The effect is NOT stable across 10-year subperiods — it is significant in 1936-1945 but not in other decades individually</li>
<li>The corrected beta of γ₂ (β₂) is essentially zero in all periods — the size effect is NOT explained by beta risk</li>
<li>γ₀ is significantly different from the risk-free rate (consistent with Black 1972)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Nonlinearity of the Size Effect (pp. 11-13, Figures 1-2)</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> plots mean residual returns against market proportion (on a logarithmic scale) for all 25 portfolios. The key visual finding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The residuals are not randomly distributed around zero. The residuals of the portfolios containing the smallest firms are all positive; the remaining ones are close to zero.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The size effect is driven entirely by the <strong>very smallest firms</strong>. Between average-sized and large firms, there is essentially no difference in risk-adjusted returns. The linear model (equation 1) understates the true size effect for the smallest firms because it cannot capture this nonlinearity.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2:</strong> Deleting the 5 smallest-firm portfolios, the γ₂ estimate barely changes (-0.00043 vs. -0.00044), confirming the effect is concentrated in small firms.</p>

<p>For the overall 1931-1975 period. Annualized, the small-minus-large spread is approximately 18-19%.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-period instability:</strong> The arbitrage returns vary substantially across 5-year subperiods. In 1941-1945, R₁ (n=10) is -0.0060 (NEGATIVE — large beat small). In 1931-1935, R₁ = 0.0589 (enormous 71% annualized!). The effect is not consistently positive in every subperiod.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Discussion — What Does Size Proxy For? (pp. 16-18)</h3>
<p>Banz is notably cautious about the interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no theoretical foundation for such an effect. We do not even know whether the factor is size itself or whether size is just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors correlated with size.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible explanations considered:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E ratio proxy:</strong> &quot;Recent work by Reinganum (1980) has eliminated one obvious candidate: the price-earnings (P/E) ratio. He finds that the P/E-effect, as reported by Basu (1977), disappears for both NYSE and AMEX stocks when he controls for size but that there is a significant size effect even when he controls for the P/E-ratio, i.e., the P/E-ratio effect is a proxy for the size effect and not vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>Banz notes: &quot;the average correlation coefficient between P/E-ratio and market value of individual stocks for thirty-eight quarters ending in 1978 is only 0.16&quot; — suggesting the two effects may be partially independent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information availability (Klein &amp; Bawa 1977):</strong> Investors have less information about small firms, so they don't hold them (limited diversification). Securities held by only a subset of investors have higher risk-adjusted returns because investors demand compensation for the estimation risk. &quot;It is likely that the amount of information generated is related to the size of the firm.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CAPM misspecification rather than inefficiency:</strong> &quot;Given its longevity, it is not likely that it is due to a market inefficiency but it is rather evidence of a pricing model misspecification.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mergers:</strong> Large firms can pay a premium for small firms because they can discount the same cash flows at a smaller discount rate. &quot;While this informal model is consistent with the empirical results, it is, nevertheless, just conjecture.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Size Effect as E/P Proxy — Basu (1983) Reverses the Conclusion</h3>
<p>Banz (1981) documents the size effect and cites Reinganum (1980) claiming P/E is a proxy for size. Two years later, Basu (1983) directly reverses this conclusion using randomized portfolios: the E/P effect is primary (F = 4.85, p &lt; 0.01) and the size effect disappears when E/P is controlled (F = 0.61, not significant). For the EPS paradigm, the Banz-Reinganum-Basu sequence is critical: size was initially thought to be the fundamental variable, but Basu showed it is the earnings yield that drives the cross-sectional return pattern.</p>
<h3>2. Small Firms Have High Earnings Yields</h3>
<p>The negative correlation between size and E/P (documented in Basu 1983, Table 1: smallest quintile E/P = 9.5%, largest quintile E/P = 6.5%) explains WHY small firms earn higher returns in the EPS paradigm: they have higher earnings yields, and the earnings yield is the cost of equity. Small firms don't earn higher returns BECAUSE they are small — they earn higher returns because the market demands a higher earnings yield to hold them.</p>
<h3>3. The Nonlinearity Maps onto Earnings Yield Nonlinearity</h3>
<p>Banz's finding that the size effect is concentrated in the very smallest firms maps onto the observation that earnings yields are most extreme (highest) for the tiniest firms. The nonlinearity in the size-return relationship reflects the nonlinearity in the E/P-return relationship for firms at the extreme of the valuation distribution.</p>
<h3>4. Banz's Caution Supports the E/P Interpretation</h3>
<p>Banz repeatedly states &quot;it is not known whether size per se is responsible for the effect&quot; and &quot;size is just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors.&quot; The EPS paradigm answers his question: the &quot;true unknown factor&quot; is the earnings yield. Size proxies for E/P, not vice versa, as Basu (1983) demonstrates.</p>
<h3>5. The CAPM Is Misspecified — But E/P Works</h3>
<p>Banz concludes the CAPM is misspecified. The EPS paradigm agrees: the CAPM's beta does not capture expected returns. But the earnings yield DOES — as Basu (1977) showed before Banz, and as Basu (1983) confirmed after. The &quot;additional factor&quot; Banz documents (size) is actually measuring the earnings yield's pricing power through a noisy proxy.</p>
<h3>6. The Sub-Period Instability Problem</h3>
<p>Table 3 shows the size effect is unstable across 5-year subperiods (negative in 1941-1945, enormous in 1931-1935). This instability weakens the case for size as a fundamental pricing variable. The earnings yield, by contrast, is more stable as a predictor of returns because it has a direct economic interpretation (cost of equity capital), while size has none — as Banz himself admits (&quot;there is no theoretical foundation for such an effect&quot;).</p>

<li><strong>Basu (1977)</strong> — Documents the P/E effect before Banz documents the size effect. Banz cites Basu and notes the potential overlap. The question of which effect is primary will be settled by Basu (1983).</li>
<li><strong>Basu (1983)</strong> — &quot;The Relationship Between Earnings' Yield, Market Value and Return for NYSE Common Stocks: Further Evidence.&quot; Directly reverses Banz's implied conclusion: E/P is primary, size is secondary. Using randomized portfolios, Basu shows the size effect disappears when E/P is controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Reinganum (1980, 1981)</strong> — &quot;Misspecification of Capital Asset Pricing: Empirical Anomalies Based on Earnings' Yields and Market Values.&quot; Claims P/E is a proxy for size. Banz cites this approvingly. Basu (1983) refutes Reinganum.</li>
<li><strong>Ball (1978)</strong> — &quot;Anomalies in Relationships Between Securities' Yields and Yield-Surrogates.&quot; Banz cites Ball's warning that anomalies may reflect model misspecification, not inefficiency. Banz adopts this cautious interpretation.</li>
<li><strong>Black, Jensen &amp; Scholes (1972)</strong> — The CAPM benchmark. Banz shows the CAPM is misspecified by documenting a size premium not captured by beta.</li>

<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (1993)</strong> — The three-factor model formalizes Banz's size effect as the SMB factor.</li>
<li><strong>Klein &amp; Bawa (1977)</strong> — &quot;The Effect of Limited Information and Estimation Risk on Optimal Portfolio Diversification.&quot; Banz's preferred explanation: investors have less information about small firms, so they require higher returns.</li>
<li><strong>Litzenberger &amp; Ramaswamy (1979)</strong> — Document the dividend yield effect. Together with Basu (1977) and Banz (1981), these papers establish that factors beyond beta predict returns.</li>
<li><strong>Roll (1977)</strong> — &quot;A Critique of the Asset Pricing Theory's Tests.&quot; Banz uses multiple market indices in response to Roll's critique that CAPM tests are sensitive to the choice of market proxy.</li>
<li><strong>Ibbotson &amp; Sinquefield (1977)</strong> — Provide the comprehensive &quot;market index&quot; (stocks + bonds) that Banz uses.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965)</strong> — The CAPM that Banz's results challenge. If the CAPM were correctly specified, γ₂ would be zero.</li>
<li><strong>Penman &amp; Reggiani (2018)</strong> — Show that E/P and B/P jointly explain the cross-section of returns. B/P (related to size) adds information beyond E/P, but E/P is the primary variable — consistent with Basu (1983) over Banz.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Banz's size effect, when reinterpreted through Basu (1983), supports the EPS paradigm. Small firms earn higher returns because they have higher earnings yields (higher cost of equity), not because they are small. The earnings yield IS the cost of equity — and it explains the &quot;size premium&quot; as simply a noisy proxy for the earnings yield premium.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — Banz's arbitrage return (1.52%/month ≈ 18%/year for small-large) is enormous and includes significant earnings yield spread. The ERP in the EPS paradigm is E/P - r_f; the small-large spread reflects the difference in earnings yields between small-cap and large-cap stocks.</li>
