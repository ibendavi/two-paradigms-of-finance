    <h2>The Research Program</h2>
    <p>
      This website accompanies the research program of
      <strong>Itzhak Ben-David</strong> (The Ohio State University) and
      <strong>Alex Chinco</strong> (Michigan State University), which proposes that
      the financial system operates on <strong>earnings capitalization</strong>, not net
      present value (NPV).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is NOT a claim about behavioral bias, market inefficiency, or managerial mistakes.
      It is a description of a <strong>robust business method that has survived centuries</strong>
      — one that NPV/discounting replaced in academic theory (post-Modigliani-Miller 1958)
      but never replaced in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Two Interrelated Paradigms</h2>

    <h3>How Investors Price Assets</h3>
    <p>
      <code style="font-size: 1.1em;">P = E(EPS) &times; P/E</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      where P/E is driven by <strong>comparables</strong> (comps), not by a discounted cash flow
      model. The discount rate is not derived from a factor model — it is the earnings yield
      itself, observable from price and earnings.
    </p>

    <h3>How Managers Make Decisions</h3>
    <p>
      <code style="font-size: 1.1em;">Maximize EPS</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Managers take the earnings yield as the <strong>market price of equity</strong>. If the
      earnings yield exceeds the borrowing rate, equity is "expensive" relative to debt, so
      the firm levers up and repurchases shares. Corporate policies (leverage, payout, M&amp;A
      payment method, investment) are means to <strong>boost EPS</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The EPS Literature collection comprises nearly 3,000 books and articles spanning
      300 years of financial thinking. It includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-1930 textbooks</strong> showing how corporate finance was taught before
        modern theory — Mead, Dewing, Gerstenberg, Lyon, Badger</li>
      <li><strong>The founding documents</strong> of modern finance — Modigliani-Miller,
        Markowitz, Sharpe, Black-Scholes</li>
      <li><strong>Transitional works</strong> where you can watch the paradigm split happen —
        Dean (1951), Weston (1962), Solomon (1963)</li>
      <li><strong>Modern textbooks</strong> that consolidate the academic view —
        Brealey &amp; Myers, Copeland &amp; Weston, Van Horne</li>
      <li><strong>Survey evidence</strong> documenting what practitioners actually do —
        Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005), Dichev et al. (2013)</li>
      <li><strong>The EPS literature</strong> — dozens of papers showing how managers use
        EPS as their primary decision metric</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Each work in the collection has been examined for its treatment of key concepts:
      valuation method, cost of equity, firm objective, leverage rationale, and decision
      rules. Structured research notes extract the key findings, important quotes, and
      historical connections. Works are classified by stream (Academic or Practitioner)
      and by paradigm affiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence pages on this site present these findings with fair-use excerpts
      and full citations. Pre-1928 works are in the public domain and can be quoted
      liberally. Modern works are cited under scholarly fair use for commentary and
      criticism.
