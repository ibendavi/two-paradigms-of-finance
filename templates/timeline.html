    <strong>Reading the timeline:</strong>
    Each dot is a textbook from our collection, scored by full-text analysis of its OCR'd content.
    Vertical position reflects <strong>valuation method</strong>: terms like "discounted cash flow,"
    "NPV," "CAPM," and "present value" pull a book
    <span class="exp-blue">upward (discounted cash flows)</span>, while "earnings per share,"
    "earnings yield," "P/E," and "capitalization rate" pull it
    <span class="exp-gold">downward (earnings capitalization)</span>.
    Color indicates stream: <span class="exp-blue">academic</span> vs.
    <span class="exp-gold">practitioner</span>.
    Only books with 20+ keyword matches are shown.
    Larger dots have detailed research notes — click them to read the evidence.
