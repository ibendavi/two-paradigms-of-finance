    <h1>The Two Paradigms</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Every concept in corporate finance has two versions: the one in the textbook
      and the one in the boardroom. Here they are, side by side, with evidence.

      The <span class="text-blue">Academic Paradigm</span> (post-1958) derives from
      Modigliani-Miller, CAPM, and efficient markets theory. The
      <span class="text-gold">Practitioner Paradigm</span> is the older framework — earnings
      capitalization, market multiples, EPS maximization — that survived the revolution
      unchanged. Neither is "wrong." They are different objective functions with different
      inputs, producing different answers.

        <h3>The Academic View</h3>
        <p>
          Practitioners who use EPS are making a <strong>mistake</strong>.
          They confuse the earnings-price ratio with the market capitalization rate
          (Brealey &amp; Myers). They fall for the "bootstrap game" in M&amp;A.
          They need to be educated out of these errors.

          "Managers frequently make poor financial decisions because they confuse
          earnings-price ratios with the market capitalization rate."

        <h3>The EPS Paradigm View</h3>
        <p>
          Practitioners who use EPS are following a <strong>different objective function</strong>,
          not making a mistake. EPS maximization is internally consistent and historically
          predates NPV by centuries. It's a robust business method, not a behavioral bias.

          "Earnings are in a class by themselves. Cash flows are nowhere
          near as important as earnings."

    <p style="max-width: 780px; margin-top: 2rem;">
      The academic paradigm needs <strong>many frictions</strong> (taxes, information asymmetry,
      agency costs, behavioral biases) to explain why firms do what they do — because the
      frictionless baseline (MM) predicts nothing should matter. The EPS paradigm generates
      predictions <strong>without frictions</strong>: leverage exists because debt is cheaper
      than the earnings yield; buybacks exist because retiring shares boosts EPS; M&amp;A is
      evaluated by EPS accretion.
