    <h1>The Split</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      In just five years (1958–1963), academic finance was transformed. The objective function
      changed from "maximize earnings" to "maximize value." But practitioners never made the switch.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prose" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">

    <h2>Before: The Consensus (pre-1958)</h2>

    <p>
      For generations, finance textbooks taught essentially the same framework.
      The firm's goal was to maximize the <strong>earning power</strong> of shareholders' capital.
      The cost of equity was the <strong>earnings yield</strong> (E/P) — an observable market rate.
      The value of a stock was <strong>earnings capitalized at a rate from comparables</strong>.
    </p>

        <h3>The Old Framework</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Maximize earning power (EPS)</li>
          <li><strong>Cost of equity:</strong> Earnings yield (E/P ~10%)</li>
          <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> V = Earnings / Cap rate (from comps)</li>
          <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> "Trading on equity" — use cheap debt to boost EPS</li>
          <li><strong>Decision rule:</strong> Does this action increase earnings per share?</li>

          <li><strong>Cost of equity:</strong> CAPM: Rf + &beta; &times; (Rm - Rf)</li>

    <h2>The Five-Year Revolution</h2>

    <h3>1952/1959 — Markowitz: Risk Gets Mathematics</h3>
    <p>
      Harry Markowitz introduces mean-variance portfolio theory. For the first time, risk isn't
      just a qualitative judgment — it's a number (variance, covariance). This is the mathematical
      foundation that will eventually produce CAPM and a theoretically derived cost of equity.
    </p>

    <h3>1958 — Modigliani &amp; Miller: Capital Structure Irrelevance</h3>
    <p>
      The bombshell. MM prove — by arbitrage — that the total value of a firm is independent of
      how it's financed. Leverage doesn't create value; it just reshuffles risk between debt and equity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is only true if the firm's goal is to <strong>maximize total firm value</strong>.
      Under the old paradigm — where the goal is to <strong>maximize EPS</strong> — leverage
      obviously matters: debt at 3% replaces equity at 10% (the earnings yield), mechanically
      boosting EPS. MM's irrelevance result implicitly assumes away the EPS objective.
    </p>

    <h3>1961 — Miller &amp; Modigliani: Dividend Irrelevance</h3>
    <p>
      The companion result: dividend policy is also irrelevant. Only investment policy matters.
      Under perfect markets, a dollar of dividends is exactly offset by a dollar of capital loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But practitioners had always cared about dividends — stable, growing dividends were the
      hallmark of a well-managed firm. MM's theorem says this is irrational. Practitioners
      disagree. The divergence deepens.
    </p>

    <h3>1962 — Weston: The Rosetta Stone</h3>

    <div class="key-finding-box">
      <h3>The Critical Passage</h3>
      <p>
        J. Fred Weston's <em>Managerial Finance</em> (1962) is the last major textbook to use E/P
        as the cost of equity. On pages 229–230, he presents a worked example showing that EPS
        maximization and value maximization give <strong>opposite answers</strong>:
      </p>
    </div>

    <table class="prose">
      <thead>
        <tr><th></th><th>No Expansion</th><th>Sell Debt</th><th>Sell Equity</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Earnings per share</strong></td>
          <td>$1.12</td>
          <td style="color: var(--gold);"><strong>$1.36</strong></td>
          <td>$1.33</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Market price per share</strong></td>
          <td>$22.40 (at 5%)</td>
          <td>$22.67 (at 6%)</td>
          <td style="color: var(--blue);"><strong>$26.60</strong> (at 5%)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      <strong>If you maximize EPS</strong> — debt wins ($1.36 vs. $1.33). <br>
      <strong>If you maximize share price</strong> — equity wins ($26.60 vs. $22.67).
    </p>
    <p>
      Weston writes: <em>"Economic theory prescribes the rule that the investor maximize the present
      worth of future earnings... Following the rule of maximizing wealth, the management should
      finance with common stock... If for some <strong>'practical'</strong> reasons, earnings per share
      is the guide, financing by debt has a small edge."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The scare quotes around "practical" are telling. Weston sees the conflict. He knows managers
      use EPS. He can't quite bring himself to call it wrong. But the writing is on the wall.

    <h3>1963 — Solomon: The Paradigm Declaration</h3>
    <p>
      Ezra Solomon's <em>The Theory of Financial Management</em> — commissioned by the Ford
      Foundation as part of a program to professionalize business education — makes the switch
      explicit:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The goal which is generally put forward is the maximization of the present worth of those
        who own the enterprise — although this is <strong>frequently stated in terms of the maximization
        of long-run earnings</strong>."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Solomon acknowledges that the old goal was EPS maximization, then replaces it with value
      maximization. This is not a discovery — it's a <strong>decision</strong>. The Ford Foundation
      and the academic establishment chose to change the objective function.
    </p>

    <h2>After: Two Worlds</h2>

    <p>
      After 1963, academic textbooks universally adopt value maximization.
      Brealey &amp; Myers (1981+) devotes three separate chapters to demolishing EPS-based reasoning.
      The CAPM (Sharpe 1964) provides a theoretically derived cost of equity, replacing the
      observable earnings yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      But practitioners never switched. Surveys of CFOs (Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal 2005)
      show that managers still maximize EPS, still use earnings yields, still evaluate M&amp;A
      by EPS accretion/dilution. Damodaran (2012) admits "most valuations done in the real world
      are relative valuations" using P/E multiples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The academy tells practitioners they're wrong. Practitioners tell the academy they're
      irrelevant. The two paradigms have coexisted — uneasily — for over 60 years.
