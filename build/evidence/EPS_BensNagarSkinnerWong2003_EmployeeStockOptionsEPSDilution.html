    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong's 2003 <em>Journal of Accounting and Economics</em> paper provides direct evidence that firms repurchase shares to offset the EPS dilution caused by employee stock options (ESOs). Using hand-collected ESO data from 10-K filings for 357 S&amp;P 500 firms (1996-1999), they show that repurchase activity increases with the dilutive effect of ESOs on EPS. The key result: the OUTS_DIL coefficient is approximately 0.2, meaning firms repurchase 0.2% of shares outstanding for every 1% increase in dilutive potential common shares from ESOs. Firms that would miss their prior-year EPS growth rate (NUM_POS coefficient ≈ 1.3, t significant at 1%) and firms with larger ESO exercise proceeds (EX_PROCEED coefficient ≈ 1.0) repurchase significantly more. Crucially, the response is STRONGER for high-P/E firms: while high-P/E firms repurchase less overall (PE_DUMMY strongly negative), the PE × OUTS_DIL interaction is positive and significant — high-P/E firms are MORE sensitive to ESO dilution even though repurchases at high P/E ratios are EPS-dilutive (because EPS/P &lt; r when P/E is high). Content analysis reveals 44% of high-P/E repurchasing firms explicitly link repurchases to offsetting ESO/EPS dilution in their annual reports. Unexercisable options of the top 5 executives (not exercisable options, not non-executive options) drive the results — consistent with GAAP-defined dilution (which includes unexercisable options in diluted EPS) being the operative concern. For the EPS project, this paper demonstrates that repurchases are a tool for managing EPS dilution, that the EPS/P &gt; r condition determines when repurchases are EPS-accretive, and that managers sacrifice EPS accretion to prevent cosmetic dilution — confirming EPS management as a first-order corporate objective.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: Introduction (pp. 51-56)</h3>
<p><strong>The phenomenon:</strong> Employee stock options (ESOs) increase diluted EPS's share count denominator, reducing reported EPS even when no options have been exercised. Under SFAS 128, the treasury stock method adds to the diluted share count all ESOs whose exercise price is below the current market price, weighted by the &quot;in-the-money&quot; fraction.</p>
<p><strong>The hypothesis:</strong> Firms repurchase shares to offset this mechanical dilution — not to maximize firm value, but to maintain or increase EPS. If the firm does nothing, diluted shares outstanding increase as ESOs vest and stock prices rise, causing EPS to fall even if earnings grow.</p>
<p><strong>The P/E condition:</strong> A repurchase increases EPS only when the earnings yield (EPS/P) exceeds the after-tax return on the cash used (r). Equivalently, repurchases are EPS-accretive when P/E &lt; 1/r. For high-P/E firms, repurchases actually REDUCE EPS — making the decision to repurchase for dilution offset even more striking, since it sacrifices EPS accretion.</p>
<p><strong>Prior literature:</strong> Weisbenner (2000) finds a correlation between option exercises and repurchases. Kahle (2002) finds firms increase repurchases in years with heavy ESO exercises. Bens et al. extend by focusing on the DILUTIVE effect on EPS (not just exercise proceeds) and by using hand-collected 10-K data on option grants, exercises, and outstanding options.</p>
<h3>Section 2: Hypothesis Development (pp. 56-60)</h3>
<p><strong>H1 (EPS dilution drives repurchases):</strong> Firms increase share repurchases in response to the actual and potential dilutive effect of ESOs on diluted EPS.</p>
<p><strong>H2 (EPS growth targets):</strong> Firms that face the prospect of missing prior-year EPS levels use repurchases to close the gap. The key variable NUM_EPS measures the shortfall: if current earnings divided by the fully diluted share count falls short of last year's EPS, NUM_EPS captures how many additional shares must be retired to achieve the target.</p>
<p><strong>H3 (P/E moderates the response):</strong> High-P/E firms should face a tension: repurchases offset ESO dilution but reduce EPS (because EPS/P &lt; r). The paper tests whether high-P/E firms repurchase less in general but are more responsive to dilution concerns.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Data and Methodology (pp. 60-66)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 357 S&amp;P 500 firms with complete hand-collected ESO data from 10-K filings, 1996-1999 (1,168 firm-quarter observations after filters). This was a period of rapidly rising stock prices and massive ESO grants, making ESO dilution particularly salient.</p>
<p><strong>Key variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OUTS_DIL:</strong> The stock-price-driven change in dilutive potential common shares from outstanding ESOs. Captures how much the rising stock price mechanically increases the diluted share count.</li>
<li><strong>NUM_EPS:</strong> The EPS shortfall — how far current earnings (divided by fully diluted shares) falls below last year's EPS. Positive when the firm would miss its target without repurchases.</li>
<li><strong>NUM_POS:</strong> = max(NUM_EPS, 0). The shortfall when it exists (zero otherwise).</li>
<li><strong>EX_PROCEED:</strong> Proceeds from ESO exercises (dollar value). Captures exercise-driven dilution.</li>
<li><strong>PE_DUMMY:</strong> = 1 if the firm's P/E exceeds the 75th percentile.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependent variable:</strong> REP_SHARES — quarterly share repurchases as a fraction of beginning-of-quarter diluted shares outstanding.</p>

<p><strong>The asymmetry in NUM_POS vs. NUM_NEG:</strong> Firms repurchase aggressively when they would miss last year's EPS (NUM_POS significant) but do NOT reduce repurchases when they exceed the target (NUM_NEG insignificant). This is consistent with EPS as a floor — managers try to prevent EPS declines but don't scale back repurchases when EPS is comfortably above target.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Cross-Sectional Tests (pp. 76-82)</h3>
<p><strong>5.1 CEO compensation interaction:</strong></p>
<p>Adding CEO_COMP (CEO cash compensation) interacted with OUTS_DIL and NUM_POS: the interactions are NOT significant. Compensation levels do not amplify the dilution-repurchase link. This suggests the EPS management motive is institutional (driven by the firm's objective function), not personal (driven by the CEO's compensation contract).</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> High-P/E firms repurchase LESS overall (PE_DUMMY negative) — consistent with the P/E condition: when P/E &gt; 1/r, repurchases reduce EPS, so rational EPS maximizers should avoid them. BUT the interaction PE × OUTS_DIL is positive and significant — high-P/E firms are MORE responsive to ESO dilution. They repurchase to offset dilution even though doing so hurts their EPS.</p>
<p>This is a critical finding: high-P/E firms sacrifice EPS accretion to prevent cosmetic dilution from ESOs. They are managing the APPEARANCE of EPS (preventing share count dilution) rather than maximizing actual EPS. This suggests the objective is not just &quot;maximize EPS&quot; but &quot;prevent visible EPS dilution from employee stock options.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Content analysis:</strong> The authors examine annual reports of high-P/E repurchasing firms. Of these, 44% explicitly state that repurchases are intended to &quot;offset dilution from stock option programs&quot; or similar language. This is direct textual evidence of the EPS dilution management motive.</p>
<h3>Section 6: Executive vs. Non-Executive Options (pp. 82-86)</h3>
<p><strong>Decomposing by option type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unexercisable options of top 5 executives:</strong> Significant predictor of repurchases</li>
<li><strong>Exercisable options of top 5 executives:</strong> NOT significant</li>
<li><strong>Non-executive options:</strong> NOT significant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why unexercisable?</strong> Under GAAP (SFAS 128), ALL in-the-money options — whether exercisable or not — enter the diluted share count. Unexercisable (unvested) options are particularly concerning because they represent FUTURE dilution that has already been granted. The finding that unexercisable executive options drive repurchases confirms that GAAP-defined dilution (the diluted EPS denominator), not actual option exercises, is the operative concern.</p>
<h3>Section 7: Conclusion (pp. 86-88)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We find that firms increase their repurchase activity in response to the dilutive effect of employee stock option plans on reported EPS.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors note: &quot;this conclusion may sound implausible to readers steeped in the neoclassical Arrow-Debreu framework in which a firm's ownership structure is irrelevant. But the pervasive use of EPS as a summary metric, and the empirical evidence that managers work to maintain EPS benchmarks (e.g., Burgstahler and Dichev 1997; Degeorge et al. 1999), makes this a plausible channel.&quot;</p>
<h3>Appendix: SBC Communications Example (pp. 88-90)</h3>
<p>Detailed example of how SBC Communications' ESO program worked in 1998: 142 million options outstanding, 76.8 million dilutive under the treasury stock method, adding 2.6% to diluted share count. SBC's 10-K explicitly states it repurchased shares to &quot;reduce the dilutive effect of stock options.&quot;</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Direct Evidence That Repurchases Manage EPS Dilution</h3>
<p>This paper provides the cleanest evidence that share repurchases are a tool for managing reported EPS. The mechanism is precise: ESOs mechanically increase the diluted share count, reducing diluted EPS. Firms repurchase specifically to offset this dilution. This is EPS management through capital allocation, exactly as the EPS paradigm describes.</p>
<h3>2. The P/E Condition Is Operational</h3>
<p>The paper derives and tests the condition under which repurchases are EPS-accretive: EPS/P &gt; r, or equivalently P/E &lt; 1/r. This is the SAME condition as in the EPS paradigm's cost-of-equity framework and in Hribar et al. (2006). The finding that high-P/E firms repurchase less overall but are more sensitive to dilution confirms that managers understand and respond to this condition.</p>
<h3>3. High-P/E Firms Sacrifice EPS Accretion to Prevent Cosmetic Dilution</h3>
<p>The most striking finding: high-P/E firms repurchase to offset ESO dilution even though doing so REDUCES EPS (because EPS/P &lt; r at high P/E). These firms accept a lower EPS level to prevent the visible share count dilution from ESOs. This reveals a hierarchy in EPS management: preventing visible dilution (which analysts and investors can directly observe in the share count) is prioritized over maximizing actual EPS. The cosmetic appearance of the EPS denominator matters.</p>
<h3>4. GAAP-Defined Dilution, Not Economic Dilution, Drives Behavior</h3>
<p>The finding that unexercisable options (which enter diluted EPS under SFAS 128 but have not been exercised) drive repurchases, while exercisable options and non-executive options do not, confirms that GAAP reporting rules — specifically the diluted EPS calculation — drive capital allocation decisions. Managers respond to accounting rules, not economic realities.</p>
<h3>5. The 44% Content Analysis Confirms the Mechanism</h3>
<p>Nearly half of high-P/E repurchasing firms explicitly state in their annual reports that repurchases offset ESO dilution. This is rare in academic finance — direct textual confirmation of the mechanism from the firms themselves.</p>
<h3>6. Compensation Does NOT Drive the Effect</h3>
<p>The null result on CEO compensation interactions suggests that EPS dilution management is an institutional objective, not a personal one. Managers manage EPS dilution regardless of their personal compensation sensitivity. This is consistent with the EPS paradigm's view that EPS maximization is a systemic business method, not a principal-agent distortion.</p>
<h3>7. The Arrow-Debreu Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The authors' remarkable statement — that their conclusion &quot;may sound implausible to readers steeped in the neoclassical Arrow-Debreu framework&quot; — is itself significant. It acknowledges that the EPS management motive contradicts textbook finance (where share count is irrelevant to value) but is empirically real. This is precisely the gap between the NPV paradigm (where EPS is irrelevant) and the EPS paradigm (where EPS is the objective function) that the Ben-David &amp; Chinco research program identifies.</p>

<li><strong>Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006)</strong> — &quot;Stock Repurchases as an Earnings Management Device.&quot; Extend Bens et al. from ESO-driven dilution to general EPS management. Both papers use the same accretion condition (EPS/P &gt; r). Hribar et al. show repurchases cluster at the meet-or-beat threshold; Bens et al. show repurchases offset ESO-specific dilution.</li>
<li><strong>Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016)</strong> — &quot;The Real Effects of Share Repurchases.&quot; Show that EPS-motivated repurchases (identified by RD design at zero pre-repurchase surprise) crowd out employment, capex, and R&amp;D. Bens et al. identify the ESO channel; Almeida et al. show the real consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Kahle (2002)</strong> — &quot;When a Buyback Isn't a Buyback.&quot; Finds firms increase repurchases in years with heavy option exercises. Bens et al. extend by focusing on the EPS dilution mechanism (not just cash flows from exercises).</li>
<li><strong>Weisbenner (2000)</strong> — &quot;Corporate Share Repurchases in the 1990s.&quot; Finds correlation between ESO exercises and repurchases. Bens et al. provide the micro-level EPS mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997)</strong> — &quot;Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses.&quot; Document earnings management around thresholds. Bens et al. show repurchases as the specific mechanism for the EPS threshold.</li>

<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; Extend from repurchases to debt-equity choice: managers prefer debt when equity issuance would be EPS-dilutive. Both papers share the EPS/P &gt; r condition.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Bens et al. confirm the central prediction: managers use capital allocation (repurchases) to maximize or protect reported EPS. The finding that high-P/E firms sacrifice EPS accretion for cosmetic dilution prevention goes even further — it shows that EPS management is not just about maximizing the EPS number but about managing its components (numerator and denominator) in ways that maintain credibility with analysts and investors.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and dividends)</strong> — The finding that repurchases are timed to offset ESO dilution provides micro-level evidence for why firms prefer repurchases over dividends: repurchases can be precisely calibrated to offset share count dilution from ESOs, while dividends cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — If firms repurchase to offset ESO dilution even when repurchases reduce EPS (high-P/E firms), the opportunity cost may include foregone investment. The cash used for dilution-offsetting repurchases could have funded positive-NPV projects.</li>
