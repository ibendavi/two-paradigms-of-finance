    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>This 1925 practitioner textbook presents earnings capitalization as THE fundamental method for valuing all securities — bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. Written 33 years before Modigliani-Miller, it demonstrates that earnings-based pricing (not DCF) was the standard framework in practice.</p>

      <h2>Central Thesis (Preface, p. viii)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The main thesis adopted is that the exchange value of all capital goods arises out of earning capacity, and that the value of securities, representing in various ways property rights to capital goods, likewise reflects earning power. In other words, <strong>security values arise from capitalized earnings.</strong> Except in those cases where no earning capacity is present, therefore, the appraisal process suggested is based on an examination of present and future earning capacity and a rate of capitalization, or yield, which expresses the principal risk factors present.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Valuation Framework</h2>
<h3>Three-Tier Approach (by Security Type)</h3>
<p><strong>1. Bonds (Chapters IV-VIII):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investment bonds: Valued by comparative yield method — find comparable bonds and price on yield basis</li>
<li>Speculative bonds: Valued by capitalizing earnings available for fixed charges at 12-15% rate</li>
<li>Default bonds: Lower limit = liquidating value of assets; upper limit = capitalized earnings</li>
<li>Worked example: &quot;Total par value of new bonds = average earnings available / rate of capitalization&quot; (p. 54)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Preferred Stock (Chapters VIII-X):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When dividends fully covered by earnings → value determined by yield comparison (like bonds)</li>
<li>When earnings 100-200% of dividend requirements → capitalize at 12-15% rate</li>
<li>Key insight: &quot;When earnings decline to a point which fails fully to protect preferred requirements, values start to fluctuate in direct sympathy with earnings&quot; (p. 105)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Common Stock (Chapters XI-XIII):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Common stock values arise largely from earning capacity — if common stock thus represents the true ownership in the corporate property, it is evident that the relation between value and earnings is closer and less restricted here than in any of the other cases treated&quot; (p. 110)</li>
<li>&quot;If we consider a corporation as a going concern, the value of its common stock must arise almost entirely out of earning capacity, as this is practically the only source from which returns to the common stockholder can arise&quot; (p. 110)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Empirical Evidence (Chapter XI, p. 120)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Study of 20 representative common stocks on NYSE and St. Louis exchange (Jan 6, 1922): <strong>ratio of earnings to market value = 18.8%</strong> (i.e., P/E ≈ 5.3x)</li>
<li>A second study of 158 audit reports (1912-?): earnings-to-capital ratios examined</li>
<li>Multiple case studies: International Mercantile Marine, Interboro Rapid Transit, International Steam Pump, Wickwire Spencer Steel, Wilson &amp; Co.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Capitalization Rates Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Investment bonds: Market yield comparison (5-7% in this era)</li>
<li>Speculative bonds: 12-15% capitalization rate on available earnings</li>
<li>Preferred stock with partial coverage: 12-15%</li>
<li>Common stock: ~18-20% earnings yield expected (roughly 5x P/E)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Conceptual Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two methods contrasted</strong>: (1) Cost/asset-based valuation vs. (2) Capitalization of earnings. Badger strongly favors (2) for industrial properties.</li>
<li><strong>Asset values as floor</strong>: &quot;There is almost always a liquidating value to a business, even though it is not capable of producing a revenue. And it is this value... that prevents underlying bonds from falling to zero&quot; (p. 61)</li>
<li><strong>Book value rejected</strong>: Book value &quot;not only ignores the actual earning ratios required by investors, especially in the case of common stocks, but it assumes that ultimate values will normally be in excess of book values&quot; (p. 150)</li>
<li><strong>Yield as the rate of capitalization</strong>: The capitalization rate is market-determined — it is the yield that investors require, observed from comparable securities</li>
</ul>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p><strong>This book is a pre-MM primary source confirming that:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Earnings capitalization was the dominant valuation method</strong> in both theory and practice before MM (1958). It was not a &quot;bias&quot; or shortcut — it was the standard analytical framework taught in university courses and used by practitioners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The formula P = E / r (or V = Earnings / Capitalization Rate)</strong> was applied to ALL securities — bonds, preferred, and common stock. The rate was determined by market comparables, not by a theoretical risk model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The earnings yield (E/P) was the &quot;cost of equity&quot;</strong> — Badger's 18.8% ratio of earnings to market value IS the earnings yield. Investors required this return to hold common stocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No present value of future cash flows</strong> — Badger values securities based on current/past earnings capitalized at a market rate. He does not project future earnings or discount them back. The framework is entirely yield-based.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk factors affect the capitalization rate</strong> — Risk is expressed through a higher required yield (capitalization rate), not through a higher discount rate applied to future cash flows. Chapter XII specifically discusses risk factors affecting capitalization rates for common stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The valuation exercise confirms historical P/E-based pricing</strong> — The empirical finding of 18.8% earnings yield (P/E ≈ 5.3x) in 1922 is a direct measure of how the market priced stocks, using the same framework the EPS project describes.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p><strong>The Consensus Era</strong> (1720–1957)</p>
        <p>For over 200 years, practitioners and scholars alike valued assets by capitalizing earnings at market-observed yields.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li>Directly supports the &quot;pre-MM world&quot; described in Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm) paper</li>
<li>Comparable to Graham &amp; Dodd (1934) approach but 9 years earlier and more explicitly focused on the capitalization formula</li>
<li>Contrasts with the DCF approach that would emerge from Fisher (1930) and be formalized by Williams (1938)</li>
<li>The Prentice-Hall publisher and Brown University affiliation suggest this was both a practitioner reference and university teaching text — bridging the two streams</li>
