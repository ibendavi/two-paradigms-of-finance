    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Joel Dean's <em>Capital Budgeting</em> (1951, Columbia University Press), credited by Solomon (1963) as the work that &quot;ushered in much of the present emphasis&quot; on capital allocation, introduces the cost-of-capital hurdle rate for project evaluation. But Dean's cost of equity IS the earnings yield: &quot;debt capital costs about 3 percent, while equity capital costs 10 percent or better in terms of current earnings&quot; (p. 50). He explicitly acknowledges that &quot;the most universally used measure of the cost of equity capital is the ratio of current prices to current earnings&quot; (p. 47). Dean also anticipates the agency problem (Jensen &amp; Meckling 1976) and the pecking order (Myers &amp; Majluf 1984) by decades. He is a transitional figure: his FRAMEWORK is the new paradigm (cost of capital as hurdle rate), but his INPUTS are the old paradigm (earnings yield from market comparables).</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Central Problem: Maximizing Earnings on Stockholders' Capital (pp. 1-2)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Planning and control of capital expenditures is the basic top-management function, since management is originally hired to take control of stockholders' funds and to maximize their earning power.&quot; (p. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Dean says &quot;maximize their earning power&quot; — NOT &quot;maximize the present value of their wealth.&quot; This is still the old paradigm's language, even as Dean is developing new analytical tools.</p>
<h3>The Earnings Yield IS the Cost of Equity (pp. 47-48, 50)</h3>
<p>The most important passage for the EPS project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The most universally used measure of the cost of equity capital is the ratio of current prices to current earnings, which would seem to be irrelevant from either management's or the market's viewpoint. Its implication about investor sophistication — namely, that the market expects current conditions to continue indefinitely — is hard to accept.&quot; (p. 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dean is describing the P/E ratio. Its inverse, E/P = earnings yield, IS the cost of equity in universal practice. Dean acknowledges this is the standard while being intellectually uncomfortable with it — the perpetuity assumption bothers him.</p>
<p>But then he admits the empirical reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, statistical analysis shows surprisingly close relations of prices to current earnings, provided that dividends and perhaps book values are also brought into the picture by multiple correlation analysis.&quot; (p. 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in practice, Dean USES the earnings yield himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;debt is much cheaper than equity capital. Nowadays, debt capital costs about 3 percent, while equity capital costs 10 percent or better in terms of current earnings.&quot; (p. 50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &quot;10 percent&quot; is the earnings yield (E/P = 1/PE = 1/10 = 10%). Dean has just stated the core of the EPS paradigm: equity costs 10% (the earnings yield), debt costs 3% (the borrowing rate), so the spread of 7% is the gain from trading on equity.</p>
<h3>Market Comparables as Cost of Equity (p. 48)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For companies whose stock has no active market or no market at all, market value may be estimated by statistical analysis of comparable companies. For instance, the combined experience in price-earnings ratios of a large sample of companies of roughly similar size and similar products... gives some background information on long-run capital costs.&quot; (p. 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the comparables approach to cost of equity: the earnings yield of comparable companies IS the cost of equity capital. This is yield-based pricing, not discount-rate modeling.</p>
<h3>Capital Structure and Trading on Equity (p. 50)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A company's cost of capital depends not only on the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital; it also depends on how much of each kind of capital it obtains. The debt ratio has a simple impact on combined cost of capital because debt is much cheaper than equity capital.&quot; (p. 50)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But the capital structure itself affects the cost of equity capital. A high debt ratio... not only increases the dangers of default on debt, but also heightens the risks of common-stock ownership, and thus raises the cost of equity capital.&quot; (p. 50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dean articulates BOTH halves of the capital structure story: (1) debt is cheaper than equity, so leverage lowers WACC (the EPS paradigm's &quot;trading on equity&quot;); (2) leverage increases equity risk and thus equity cost (anticipating MM Proposition II by 7 years). He recognizes the tension but doesn't resolve it formally.</p>
<h3>Tax Advantage of Debt (p. 51)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the corporation income tax, which makes the unjustifiable distinction between interest as a deductible expense and dividends as taxable earnings. If the government takes [50%] of earnings... investments financed with stock must have gross (before-tax) profit prospects that are twice as high as debt-financed earnings.&quot; (p. 51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dean's worked example: at 50% tax rate, a $1,000 investment financed entirely by debt need earn only $50; financed entirely by equity, it must earn $100. This is the tax shield argument that MM (1963) would formalize 12 years later.</p>
<h3>Anticipating the Agency Problem (pp. 44, 54-56)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This opportunity-cost principle has a tone of unreality, however, since it implies that the stockholder is king and that financial policy is aimed solely at maximizing the value of his capital. In most companies profit maximization in the financial sense is qualified and transformed to allow for management's own ambitions to grow or for their natural desires to avoid the capital markets and the SEC.&quot; (p. 44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This anticipates Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976) by 25 years. Dean explicitly notes the divergence between stockholder interests and management interests.</p>
<p>On management conservatism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The men who make the decisions rarely regard the profit prospects as adequate to offset the threat offered to their personal security by general reorganization in bankruptcy.&quot; (p. 55)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;management's share in the profits of successful ventures (in the form of dividends on the stock they own) is an insignificant source of income compared with their salaries, which show admirable stability over the business cycle.&quot; (p. 55)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Anticipating the Pecking Order (pp. 53-57)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For many firms it is a source of pride that they never go to the market for financing a new opportunity, no matter how profitable it appears. They determine the amount of capital available for new schemes not on the basis of earning prospects, but on the basis of availability of cash from retained earnings.&quot; (pp. 53-54)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dean identifies and names the &quot;aversion to external financing.&quot; He provides a hierarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retained earnings (preferred — no market exposure, no restrictions)</li>
<li>Debt (next — restricts management but doesn't dilute control)</li>
<li>Equity (last resort — SEC regulations, market exposure, dilution risk)</li>
</ol>
<p>This IS the pecking order of Myers &amp; Majluf (1984), documented 33 years earlier — and driven by management self-interest, not information asymmetry.</p>
<h3>The Capital Budget as Management's Central Framework (pp. 1-10)</h3>
<p>Dean's core innovation is treating capital allocation as the central problem of management:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In a broad sense, therefore, product-line policy, promotion, pricing, and labor relations can be viewed as subsidiary problems of administering management's trusteeship over capital.&quot; (p. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Although capital budgeting is conceptually, at least, the universal business problem, encompassing all others, few executives are happy with their own solutions to it.&quot; (p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four capital budgeting problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Demand for capital</strong> — survey of profitable investment opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Supply of capital</strong> — how much is available (internal + external)</li>
<li><strong>Rationing</strong> — how to allocate limited funds among competing projects</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong> — when to invest (cyclical considerations)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cost of Capital Function Shape (pp. 51-52)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it is probable that the cost of capital function is flat over a wide range of investment. But at some point it rises, and probably precipitously.&quot; (p. 52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dean describes the supply-of-capital curve as having a flat segment (internal funds at the earnings yield) and then a steep rise (when external financing becomes necessary). This is a precursor to the traditional U-shaped cost-of-capital curve that Solomon (1963) and MM would debate.</p>
<h3>Payout Period vs. Profitability Yield (pp. 24-27)</h3>
<p>Dean distinguishes between two methods of evaluating projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payout period</strong> — how long until the investment returns its cost (the practitioner standard)</li>
<li><strong>Profitability yield</strong> — the internal rate of return (Dean's preferred measure)</li>
</ul>
<p>He criticizes payout period but acknowledges its universal use: it is &quot;the most common yardstick for measuring the desirability of investment expenditures&quot; (p. 24). This reflects the tension between practitioner simplicity and analytical rigor.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Cost of Equity IS the Earnings Yield — Even for the Pioneer</h3>
<p>Dean, the very person who introduced formalized capital budgeting, uses the earnings yield (E/P = ~10%) as his cost of equity. He's intellectually uncomfortable with it (&quot;hard to accept&quot; that markets expect current conditions to continue indefinitely) but acknowledges it's &quot;the most universally used measure&quot; and employs it in his own analysis. This confirms the EPS paradigm: practitioners derive the cost of equity from the observable earnings yield, not from a theoretical risk model.</p>
<h3>2. Transitional Figure: New Framework, Old Inputs</h3>
<p>Dean's FRAMEWORK (hurdle rate, cost of capital, demand/supply of capital) is the new paradigm that Solomon, MM, and eventually CAPM would build on. But his INPUTS (earnings yield as cost of equity, comparables for valuation) are the old paradigm. The full NPV paradigm requires CAPM-derived discount rates (Sharpe 1964), which don't exist yet in 1951. Dean is the bridge between Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940) and Solomon (1963).</p>
<h3>3. Agency Problem and Pecking Order — Decades Before the Literature</h3>
<p>Dean's descriptions of management aversion to external financing (pecking order) and management self-interest (agency problem) are strikingly modern. But they're presented as simple OBSERVATIONS about how firms actually behave, not as theoretical models requiring information asymmetry or agency costs. In the EPS paradigm, these are not &quot;frictions&quot; — they're descriptions of how the business method works.</p>
<h3>4. Debt vs. Equity Cost Spread = Trading on Equity</h3>
<p>Dean's &quot;3 percent debt vs. 10 percent equity&quot; spread is the core of the EPS paradigm's capital structure prediction: when the borrowing rate (3%) is below the earnings yield (10%), equity is &quot;expensive&quot; relative to debt, and rational managers lever up. Dean sees this clearly but doesn't frame it as EPS maximization — he frames it as minimizing the weighted-average cost of capital.</p>
<h3>5. The Practical Consultant's View</h3>
<p>Dean was both an academic (Columbia) and a practicing consultant (Joel Dean Associates, working with Socony-Vacuum, General Electric, General Motors, Gulf Oil, Shell Oil, Standard Oil). His book reflects actual corporate practice in the early 1950s, not just theory. When he says the earnings yield is the universal cost-of-equity measure, he's reporting what America's largest corporations actually used.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — &quot;Joel Dean, whose pioneer work in capital budgeting in 1951 ushered in much of the present emphasis on this subject&quot; (Solomon, p. x). Dean is Solomon's acknowledged starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> — Dean's &quot;10% equity cost, 3% debt cost&quot; framework is &quot;trading on equity&quot; quantified. Where Guthmann taught the logic qualitatively, Dean provides the numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — Dean anticipates both MM Proposition II (leverage raises equity cost) and the tax-shield argument (MM 1963) by 7-12 years. His cost-of-capital discussion is a precursor to the MM debate.</li>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — Dean's observations about management self-interest (&quot;management's own ambitions to grow,&quot; &quot;personal security&quot;) anticipate agency theory by 25 years.</li>
<li><strong>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984)</strong> — Dean's &quot;aversion to external financing&quot; IS the pecking order, documented 33 years earlier, but attributed to management self-interest rather than information asymmetry.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpe (1964) / CAPM</strong> — Dean has no theoretical model for the cost of equity. He uses market comparables (earnings yields of similar firms). CAPM will eventually provide the theoretical alternative, replacing the earnings yield with a beta-derived required return.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Dean is a critical transitional figure. His text shows that even as the NPV framework was being born, its inputs were earnings-based. The &quot;new paradigm&quot; of capital budgeting still relied on the &quot;old paradigm's&quot; cost of equity (the earnings yield).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — Dean's hurdle rate IS the earnings yield. If managers evaluate projects by comparing expected returns to the earnings yield, the EPS paradigm and the NPV paradigm give similar project rankings — the difference arises only when CAPM-derived discount rates diverge from earnings yields.</li>
