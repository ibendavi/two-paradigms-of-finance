    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Penman &amp; Reggiani's 2018 <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em> paper (SSRN working paper July 2018, earlier title &quot;The Value Trap: Value Buys Risky Growth&quot;) provides a unified framework connecting the earnings yield (E/P), the book-to-price ratio (B/P), return on equity (ROE), expected returns (r), and expected earnings growth (g). Starting from P₀ = Earnings₁/(r - g), they derive E/P = r - g (equation 1a) and B/P = (1/ROE) × (r - g) (equation 2). The central insight: for a given E/P (i.e., for a given r - g), B/P sorts firms by inverse ROE — high B/P means low ROE, which under conservative accounting indicates HIGH expected earnings growth and HIGH risk. Thus &quot;value&quot; investing (buying high B/P stocks) does not buy safe cheapness — it buys risky growth. This is the &quot;value trap&quot;: value stocks appear cheap but actually bear growth risk that justifies their high expected returns. Using NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ data 1963-2015 (176,848 firm-years), double sorts on E/P × B/P show that mean returns range from 1.9% (low E/P, low B/P) to 27.1% (high E/P, high B/P), and B/P is positively associated with subsequent earnings growth and earnings volatility for given E/P. For the EPS project, this paper is essential because it shows that the earnings yield (E/P) IS the pricing variable that determines expected returns, with B/P serving merely as a proxy for growth expectations conditional on E/P.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Framework: E/P = r - g (pp. 2-6)</h3>
<p>Starting from the standard constant-growth model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = Earnings₁/(r - g)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rearranging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>E/P = r - g</strong>    (Equation 1a)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earnings yield equals the expected return minus the expected earnings growth rate. This is a tautology given the constant-growth assumption, but it has powerful implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>E/P does NOT equal r (the expected return) unless g = 0</li>
<li>E/P understates r when growth is positive</li>
<li>E/P overstates r when growth is negative (earnings decline)</li>
<li>Two firms with the same E/P can have very different r and g, as long as r - g is the same</li>
</ul>
<h3>B/P as a Function of E/P and ROE (pp. 5-7)</h3>
<p>Multiply and divide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B/P = (Book Value₀/Earnings₁) × (Earnings₁/P₀) = (1/ROE) × E/P</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B/P = (1/ROE) × (r - g)</strong>    (Equation 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This decomposes B/P into two components: the inverse of profitability (1/ROE) and the earnings yield (r - g).</p>
<h3>Three Properties for Given E/P (pp. 7-9)</h3>
<p>For a fixed level of E/P (i.e., fixed r - g):</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong> B/P is determined by the inverse of ROE. Higher B/P ↔ lower ROE.</p>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong> If lower ROE indicates higher expected earnings growth (which conservative accounting implies), then higher B/P → higher expected g.</p>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong> If higher B/P → higher g, and E/P = r - g is fixed, then higher B/P → higher r (expected return). Higher growth must be accompanied by higher required return to keep E/P constant.</p>
<h3>The Conservative Accounting Mechanism (pp. 8-11)</h3>
<p>Why does low ROE signal high expected growth? Under conservative (GAAP) accounting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earnings recognition is deferred until uncertainty is resolved</li>
<li>R&amp;D, advertising, brand-building expenses are written off immediately (not capitalized)</li>
<li>This depresses current book value and current earnings for firms with significant growth investments</li>
<li>BUT these investments generate future earnings growth</li>
<li>Therefore: low current ROE (due to conservative accounting) → high expected future earnings growth</li>
</ul>
<p>This is NOT a market inefficiency — it is an accounting measurement property. Conservative accounting creates a mechanical link between low current profitability and high future growth.</p>
<h3>Table 1: Double Sort Returns — E/P × B/P (pp. 12-14)</h3>
<p>176,848 firm-years, NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ 1963-2015. Mean annual returns:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Low B/P</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>High B/P</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Low E/P</td>
<td>1.9%</td>
<td>4.3%</td>
<td>5.2%</td>
<td>9.1%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>10.1%</td>
<td>12.5%</td>
<td>12.5%</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>High E/P</td>
<td>14.1%</td>
<td>17.2%</td>
<td>20.1%</td>
<td>27.1%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>E/P sorts returns powerfully (rows): low E/P earns ~1.9-9.1%, high E/P earns ~14.1-27.1%</li>
<li>B/P adds further return variation within E/P classes (columns): for given E/P, high B/P → higher returns</li>
<li>The full spread is enormous: 27.1% - 1.9% = 25.2 percentage points</li>
<li>B/P is NOT redundant with E/P — it captures additional information about expected returns</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 2: B/P Predicts Earnings Growth (pp. 14-15)</h3>
<p>For given E/P, high B/P firms have HIGHER subsequent earnings growth:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Low B/P</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>High B/P</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Low E/P</td>
<td>High growth</td>
<td>←</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Higher growth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High E/P</td>
<td>Lower growth</td>
<td>←</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Higher growth</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This confirms Property (ii): B/P captures expected growth through the conservative accounting channel. High B/P = low ROE = deferred earnings recognition = higher future earnings growth.</p>
<h3>Table 3: B/P and Earnings Volatility (pp. 15-16)</h3>
<p>For given E/P, high B/P is associated with higher earnings volatility (measured by standard deviation and interdecile range of future earnings changes):</p>
<p>Higher B/P → higher earnings risk for given E/P</p>
<p>This confirms Property (iii): the higher expected growth associated with high B/P comes with higher risk — justifying higher expected returns.</p>
<h3>Table 4: Earnings Betas (pp. 16-17)</h3>
<p>Earnings betas (sensitivity of firm earnings to aggregate earnings) increase in B/P for given E/P. High B/P firms have higher systematic earnings risk. This provides a fundamental (earnings-based) explanation for the &quot;value premium&quot;: it is compensation for bearing systematic earnings risk, not a behavioral anomaly.</p>
<h3>Case Studies (pp. 17-20)</h3>
<p>Penman &amp; Reggiani illustrate with specific firms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verizon</strong> (high E/P, low B/P, high ROE): stable, low-growth, low risk — &quot;true value&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Sanofi</strong> (high E/P, high B/P, low ROE): appears cheap but has risky growth — &quot;value trap&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> (low E/P, low B/P, very high ROE): high growth priced in, low risk of delivering — &quot;quality growth&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> (low E/P, high B/P, low ROE): growth stock with low current profitability — &quot;speculative growth&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (moderate E/P, low B/P, high ROE): franchise value, stable</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> (low E/P, high B/P, low ROE): massive growth investment depressing current ROE</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks</strong> (low E/P, low B/P, high ROE): high current profitability with growth priced in</li>
</ul>
<h3>The &quot;Value Trap&quot; Explained (pp. 18-20)</h3>
<p>The &quot;value trap&quot; is the phenomenon where &quot;value&quot; stocks (high B/P) underperform despite appearing cheap. Penman &amp; Reggiani explain: these stocks are not cheap — they are bearing growth risk. Their high B/P reflects low ROE from conservative accounting, which in turn reflects growth investments whose payoffs are uncertain. When the growth fails to materialize, the stock collapses. The high average return to &quot;value&quot; investing compensates for this risk of growth failure.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. E/P = r - g Vindicates the Earnings Yield as the Core Pricing Variable</h3>
<p>Penman &amp; Reggiani's framework starts from E/P = r - g. The earnings yield is the spread between the expected return and expected growth. When g ≈ 0 (mature firms), E/P ≈ r — the earnings yield IS the expected return, exactly as the EPS paradigm claims. Even when g ≠ 0, E/P remains the central pricing variable that determines how investors capitalize earnings.</p>
<h3>2. E/P Dominates B/P as the Primary Return Predictor</h3>
<p>Table 1 shows that E/P sorts returns more powerfully than B/P. The row spread (E/P) is much larger than the column spread (B/P). This is consistent with Basu (1977, 1983): the earnings yield is the primary cross-sectional predictor of returns. Fama &amp; French's emphasis on B/P (HML) may have the causation backward — E/P is the more fundamental variable, and B/P adds information only about the decomposition of E/P into r and g.</p>
<h3>3. The P/E Multiple Reflects Growth Expectations</h3>
<p>In the EPS paradigm, the P/E multiple comes from &quot;comps&quot; — comparable firms. Penman &amp; Reggiani's framework reveals what comps are estimating: the growth rate g. High P/E (low E/P) firms have high expected growth, so their earnings are capitalized at a higher multiple. Low P/E (high E/P) firms have low or negative expected growth. The &quot;comps&quot; process is a practical method for estimating g.</p>
<h3>4. The &quot;Value Premium&quot; Is an Earnings Yield Premium</h3>
<p>The high returns to &quot;value&quot; stocks are not a puzzle in the Penman &amp; Reggiani framework: high B/P stocks have high expected returns because they bear systematic earnings risk. In the EPS paradigm, this translates directly: high earnings yield firms earn high returns because the earnings yield IS the expected return (adjusted for growth). The &quot;value premium&quot; is simply the spread between high and low earnings yields.</p>
<h3>5. Conservative Accounting Connects to EPS Paradigm's Use of Reported Earnings</h3>
<p>Penman &amp; Reggiani show that conservative accounting creates the link between low ROE and high growth. In the EPS paradigm, managers maximize REPORTED EPS — which is determined by conservative GAAP accounting. The same accounting rules that create the value/growth distinction in Penman &amp; Reggiani's framework are the rules that determine the EPS managers seek to maximize.</p>
<h3>6. Book Value Is Secondary — Earnings Are Primary</h3>
<p>The framework shows B/P only matters because it captures information about ROE and growth CONDITIONAL on E/P. Strip away B/P, and E/P still predicts returns (the row sort in Table 1). This aligns with the EPS paradigm's focus on earnings rather than book value: earnings capitalization (P = EPS × P/E) is the primary pricing mechanism, and book value enters only as a secondary indicator of earnings quality/persistence.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Basu (1977)</strong> — Documents the P/E effect (high E/P → high returns). Penman &amp; Reggiani provide the theoretical framework: E/P = r - g, so high E/P → high r (when controlling for or understanding g).</li>
<li><strong>Basu (1983)</strong> — Shows E/P dominates size in predicting returns. Penman &amp; Reggiani's Table 1 shows E/P dominates B/P in the double sort — consistent across two decades of research.</li>
<li><strong>Fama &amp; French (1992, 1993)</strong> — FF emphasize B/P (HML) as the value factor. Penman &amp; Reggiani show B/P is secondary to E/P and captures growth/risk conditional on E/P. This challenges the FF framework's focus on B/P rather than E/P.</li>
<li><strong>Ohlson (1995)</strong> — Ohlson's model with ω = 1 gives P = φx - d (pure earnings capitalization). Penman &amp; Reggiani's E/P = r - g framework is the empirical counterpart, showing how earnings capitalization works in practice with growth firms.</li>
<li><strong>Ou &amp; Penman (1989)</strong> — Document the Molodovsky/P-E effect: mean-reversion in P/E ratios driven by transitory earnings. Penman &amp; Reggiani extend this by showing how B/P captures the growth that drives P/E dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Lakonishok, Shleifer &amp; Vishny (1994)</strong> — &quot;Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation, and Risk.&quot; LSV argue the value premium is behavioral (extrapolation bias). Penman &amp; Reggiani argue it is rational compensation for earnings risk. The EPS paradigm is agnostic: the premium exists because E/P is the cost of equity.</li>
<li><strong>Ball (1978)</strong> — &quot;Anomalies in Relationships Between Securities' Yields and Yield-Surrogates.&quot; Ball argues anomalies reflect omitted risk factors. Penman &amp; Reggiani identify the specific risk: systematic earnings volatility associated with growth investments under conservative accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Penman (2010)</strong> — <em>Accounting for Value</em>. Penman's textbook develops the E/P and B/P framework at length. This paper provides the formal empirical documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon (1959)</strong> — The constant growth model P = D/(r-g). Penman &amp; Reggiani translate this into earnings terms: P = E/(r-g), giving E/P = r-g.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</strong> — Graham &amp; Dodd use the earnings yield as the measure of value. Penman &amp; Reggiani show this measure captures r - g, validating Graham &amp; Dodd's use of E/P as a value indicator while clarifying its relation to expected returns.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Penman &amp; Reggiani's E/P = r - g framework formalizes the EPS paradigm's central claim: the earnings yield is the observable market price of equity. When g ≈ 0, E/P = r — the earnings yield IS the cost of equity. Even with growth, E/P captures the core pricing relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> — The P/E multiple in Penman &amp; Reggiani's framework is 1/(r - g). Investors estimate this from comps — comparable firms with similar growth and risk profiles. This is exactly the EPS × P/E pricing mechanism the investor-side paper describes.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — Penman &amp; Reggiani imply ERP = r - r_f = E/P + g - r_f. For the market as a whole, if growth equals the economy's growth rate, the ERP is approximately the aggregate earnings yield plus GDP growth minus the risk-free rate. In the EPS paradigm's simplest formulation (g ≈ 0 for the representative firm), ERP ≈ E/P - r_f — the observable earnings yield spread.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-looking AP)</strong> — Penman &amp; Reggiani use CURRENT earnings and book value to sort stocks and predict FUTURE returns. This is backward-looking asset pricing: current accounting data determines expected returns. The backward-looking approach works because current earnings are informative about future earnings (Ohlson's ω &gt; 0).</li>
