    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Myers &amp; Majluf's 1984 <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> paper (NBER Working Paper No. 1396) provides the formal theoretical foundation for the pecking order theory of capital structure. In a three-date model where managers know more about the firm's value than outside investors, the firm may rationally pass up positive-NPV investment opportunities rather than issue equity at an undervalued price. The key mechanism: when the firm issues stock, rational investors infer the stock is overvalued (adverse selection), so the issue price falls. The issue-invest condition is (E/P')(S+a) &lt;= E+b — the firm issues only when the dilution cost to old shareholders is offset by the NPV of the investment. The central results are: (1) firms prefer internal financing to external financing; (2) if external finance is needed, debt dominates equity because it has lower information costs; (3) financial slack (cash, liquid assets, borrowing capacity) has positive value because it prevents underinvestment; and (4) the decision to issue stock always conveys bad news (P' &lt; P). These results generate the &quot;pecking order&quot;: internal funds first, then safe debt, then risky debt, then equity as a last resort. For the EPS project, this paper is the canonical NPV-paradigm explanation for why firms avoid equity issuance — an explanation that requires the friction of information asymmetry, whereas the EPS paradigm generates the same prediction (equity avoidance) directly from the objective function (EPS dilution) without any friction.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Model Setup (Section 1, pp. 3-9 of WP)</h3>
<p><strong>Three dates:</strong> t = -1 (before any information arrives), t = 0 (managers learn private information, make issue-invest decision), t = +1 (all information becomes public).</p>
<p><strong>The firm has:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assets-in-place worth <strong>a</strong> (known to managers at t=0, not to investors)</li>
<li>An investment opportunity with NPV <strong>b</strong> &gt;= 0 (known to managers at t=0, not to investors)</li>
<li>Financial slack <strong>S</strong> (cash, liquid assets — known to everyone)</li>
<li>The investment requires outlay <strong>I</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information structure:</strong> At t = -1, both managers and investors know only the joint distribution of (A, B). At t = 0, managers learn the true values (a, b); investors still know only the distributions. At t = +1, all information becomes public.</p>
<p><strong>Financing:</strong> If S &lt; I, the firm must raise E = I - S by issuing stock. The issue price P' reflects investors' rational expectations conditional on the firm's decision to issue.</p>
<p><strong>Management's objective:</strong> Maximize the value of the &quot;old&quot; (existing) shareholders' stake. Three variants are considered: (1) all shareholders, (2) old shareholders who are passive, (3) old shareholders who actively rebalance.</p>
<h3>The Issue-Invest Condition (Section 2, pp. 19-20)</h3>
<p>The firm issues and invests only if old shareholders are better off issuing than not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Share of existing assets and slack going to new stockholders &lt;= Share of increment to firm value obtained by old stockholders</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(E/P')(S + a) &lt;= E + b</strong> (Inequality 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The line (E/P')(S + a) = E + b divides the joint distribution of (A, B) into two regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Region M' (Issue and Invest):</strong> The firm issues stock and undertakes the investment</li>
<li><strong>Region M (Do Nothing):</strong> The firm passes up the investment to avoid selling undervalued shares</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Numerical Example (pp. 10-13)</h3>
<p><strong>Two equally probable states:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>State 1</th>
<th>State 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Assets-in-place (a)</td>
<td>150</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Investment NPV (b)</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Investment cost (I)</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slack (S)</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Trial solution: Always issue (P' = 115).</strong> If the firm always issues at P' = S + A-bar + B-bar = 0 + 100 + 15 = 115:</p>
<ul>
<li>In State 2: V_old = (S + a)/(P' + E) × (P' + E + b) = 50/215 × 225 = 52.3 &gt; 50 (gain from issuing)</li>
<li>In State 1: V_old = 150/215 × 270 = 188.4... but wait: V_old = 150/(115+100) × (150+20+100) = 150/215 × 270 = 188.4, while doing nothing gives V_old = 150. Since 188.4 &gt; 150...</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, the correct calculation: V_old = (P')/(P' + E) × (S + a + b + I) = 115/215 × 270 = 144.4 in State 1. But doing nothing gives a + S = 150. Since 144.4 &lt; 150, the firm won't issue in State 1.</p>
<p><strong>Equilibrium: Issue only in State 2.</strong> P' = S + A-bar(M') + B-bar(M') = 0 + 50 + 10 = 60. The firm passes up a project with NPV = 20 in State 1.</p>
<p><strong>Ex ante loss:</strong> V = 105 instead of 115 (potential value if both projects taken). Loss L = 10 = F(M) × B-bar(M) = 0.5 × 20.</p>
<p><strong>With slack S = 100:</strong> The firm can self-finance and invest in both states. V = 115 + 10 (slack) = 125. Slack has ex ante NPV of 10.</p>
<h3>Properties of Equilibrium (pp. 21-26)</h3>
<p><strong>Ex ante loss:</strong> L = F(M) × B-bar(M) — the probability of not issuing times the average NPV foregone. The loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases as E (required equity issue) increases</li>
<li>Decreases as S (financial slack) increases</li>
<li>Decreases as sigma_A (uncertainty about assets-in-place) decreases</li>
<li>When S &gt;= I, L = 0 (no need to issue)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>a</strong> is known to investors (no asymmetric info about assets-in-place), stock is always issued when b &gt;= 0. Asymmetric info about investment alone doesn't prevent issuance.</li>
<li>Need asymmetric info about <strong>both</strong> assets-in-place AND investment opportunities for interesting results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stock issues always reduce stock price:</strong> P' &lt; P unless the issue is a foregone conclusion. The decision not to issue signals a &gt; P' - S, i.e., the true value exceeds the issue price — so P (conditional on no issue) &gt; P' (conditional on issue). &quot;The reason a firm decides not to issue is that a &gt; P'(1 + b/E) - S... it signals that the true value of slack and assets in place exceed P'.&quot;</p>
<h3>Numerical Simulations (Table 1, p. 27a)</h3>
<p>With A and B jointly lognormal (A-bar = 100, B-bar = 1 or 10, sigma_A = 10 or 100), varying slack S from 0 to 100% of I:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Key insight: When slack covers the full investment (S = 100% of I), the loss is always zero. When sigma_A is large (high uncertainty about assets), the loss is large even with moderate slack.</p>
<h3>Debt Financing (pp. 28-32)</h3>
<p><strong>Key result: Debt dominates equity.</strong></p>
<p>If the firm can issue <strong>default-risk free debt</strong>, the problem disappears entirely — the firm never passes up a positive-NPV investment. Risk-free debt is equivalent to financial slack.</p>
<p>If the firm can only issue <strong>risky debt</strong>, the problem is alleviated but not eliminated. The firm sometimes passes up positive-NPV investments, but the average opportunity loss is less than with equity financing.</p>
<p><strong>The proof that debt dominates equity (pp. 29-31):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With equity: firm issues if b &gt;= Delta_E (capital gain to new stockholders)</li>
<li>With debt: firm issues if b &gt;= Delta_D (capital gain to new bondholders)</li>
<li>By option pricing theory, Delta_E and Delta_D have the same sign, but |Delta_E| &gt; |Delta_D|</li>
<li>Therefore: whenever equity financing is acceptable, debt financing is too — but not vice versa</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result: &quot;In our model, the firm never issues equity. If it issues and invests, it always issues debt, regardless of whether the firm is over- or undervalued.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This is the formal derivation of the pecking order: the general rule is to &quot;issue safe securities than risky ones.&quot;</p>
<h3>Section 3: Assumptions About Management's Objectives (pp. 33-35a)</h3>
<p><strong>The irrelevance of financing under active shareholders:</strong> If old stockholders can rebalance their portfolios freely in frictionless capital markets, the firm's investment decision is independent of whether cash starts in shareholders' bank accounts or the firm's. The equilibrium conditions in the two cases (Table 2) are identical. This yields an MM-like proposition of financial irrelevance.</p>
<p><strong>But:</strong> If managers worry about the price at which old shareholders trade after an internally-financed investment, the same underinvestment problem reappears. The decision to invest using internal cash reveals information just as issuing stock does.</p>
<p><strong>The &quot;passive investor&quot; assumption</strong> is more empirically relevant: managers act in old shareholders' interests, assuming those shareholders do not rebalance. Under this assumption, financing matters and the pecking order emerges.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Extensions and Implications (pp. 40-45)</h3>
<p><strong>Temporary vs. permanent information asymmetry:</strong> If the asymmetry is temporary, the &quot;easy way out&quot; is to issue stock at t = -1 when managers and investors share the same information. If permanent (managers always one period ahead), the problem recurs: issuing stock at t = -1 to build slack creates a new adverse selection problem.</p>
<p><strong>Dividends:</strong> The model adds one argument for low dividend payouts — to build slack and avoid future reliance on external equity financing. But dividends may also help signal the true value of assets-in-place, reducing sigma_A.</p>
<p><strong>Mergers:</strong> A merger between a cash-rich firm and a slack-poor firm increases combined value (by transferring slack). But negotiated mergers face the same adverse selection: the cash-poor firm's willingness to sell reveals bad news. Cash tender offers made by the buyer directly to the target's shareholders can work because they convey no bad news about a + b + S.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Conclusion (pp. 46-47)</h3>
<p>Six key properties of the model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Better to issue safe securities than risky ones.</strong> Firms should go to bond markets for external capital, but raise equity by retention if possible. Debt financing dominates equity financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firms may forego good investments</strong> rather than issue risky securities. Stockholders are better off ex ante when the firm carries sufficient financial slack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firms can build up financial slack</strong> by restricting dividends when investment requirements are modest. Cash saved is held as marketable securities or reserve borrowing power. Build slack through retention rather than stock issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The firm should not pay a dividend</strong> if it has to recoup the cash by selling stock or risky securities. Unless dividends signal true asset values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stock issues to finance investment cause stock price to fall.</strong> This is in the existing stockholders' interest. Issuing risk-free debt does not cause a price decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mergers of slack-rich and slack-poor firms increase combined value.</strong> But negotiating such mergers is difficult without information disclosure; cash tender offers may be necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The NPV Paradigm's Friction Machine</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf is the paradigmatic example of what the EPS project calls the NPV paradigm's &quot;friction machine.&quot; To explain why firms avoid equity issuance — an obvious empirical fact — the NPV paradigm needs an elaborate theoretical apparatus: asymmetric information, adverse selection, rational expectations equilibrium, and the specific assumption that managers maximize old shareholders' value. The EPS paradigm generates the same prediction (firms avoid equity issuance) directly from the objective function: issuing equity at the earnings yield dilutes EPS unless the project return exceeds the earnings yield. No friction needed.</p>
<h3>2. &quot;The Firm Never Issues Equity&quot; — The Same Prediction, Different Mechanism</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf's most striking result is that &quot;the firm never issues equity. If it issues and invests, it always issues debt.&quot; The EPS paradigm predicts the same: equity is expensive (the earnings yield exceeds the debt rate), so firms prefer debt. The difference is the WHY: Myers &amp; Majluf attribute equity avoidance to information costs; the EPS paradigm attributes it to the direct EPS arithmetic (debt at a lower rate than the earnings yield boosts EPS).</p>
<h3>3. Financial Slack = EPS Flexibility</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf's emphasis on financial slack (cash reserves, unused debt capacity) as having positive value maps onto the EPS paradigm's view that firms maintain financial slack to preserve EPS flexibility. A firm with cash can invest without diluting EPS through either stock or expensive debt issuance.</p>
<h3>4. Stock Issues as Bad News — The EPS Version</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf show that stock issues always convey bad news (P' &lt; P). In the EPS paradigm, stock issues are bad news for a simpler reason: they dilute EPS. The market reaction is negative because more shares outstanding reduces EPS, and with earnings capitalization (P = EPS x P/E), lower EPS means lower price. Both frameworks predict negative announcement returns, but the mechanisms differ.</p>
<h3>5. The &quot;Passive Investor&quot; Assumption Is the EPS Assumption</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf's analysis depends critically on the assumption that managers act on behalf of &quot;passive&quot; old shareholders who do not rebalance. Under the &quot;active shareholder&quot; assumption, financing is irrelevant (Section 3). The EPS paradigm's manager is effectively acting for passive shareholders: maximizing EPS benefits whoever currently holds the shares, regardless of their portfolio strategy.</p>
<h3>6. The Merger Implication — Cash vs. Stock Deals</h3>
<p>Myers &amp; Majluf's prediction that cash mergers dominate stock mergers (because stock deals signal overvaluation) parallels the EPS paradigm's prediction: stock deals dilute EPS (more shares outstanding for the same earnings), while cash deals funded by debt may be EPS-accretive. Both predict the empirical pattern (cash deals receive better market reactions), but for different reasons.</p>
<h3>7. Why This Matters: Competing Explanations for the Same Facts</h3>
<p>Every empirical pattern explained by Myers &amp; Majluf (equity avoidance, debt preference, stock price decline on equity issuance, value of financial slack, cash &gt; stock mergers) is also explained by the EPS paradigm — without requiring information asymmetry. The key question for the EPS project is: which explanation actually drives managerial behavior? The survey evidence (Graham &amp; Harvey 2001: managers cite EPS dilution as a primary concern in equity issuance decisions) favors the EPS mechanism.</p>

<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Myers &amp; Majluf is the primary competing explanation for equity avoidance, debt preference, and financial slack hoarding. The EPS paradigm generates all the same predictions without requiring asymmetric information — just the objective of maximizing EPS.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Myers &amp; Majluf (1984) exemplifies the post-MM research program: start from irrelevance, add a friction (information asymmetry), derive capital structure relevance. The EPS paradigm's critique is that this is &quot;stone soup&quot; — the friction does all the work, and you could get the same results more simply by changing the objective function.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — Myers &amp; Majluf show that information costs can cause underinvestment (firms pass up positive-NPV projects). The EPS paradigm shows that EPS maximization can cause a different kind of misallocation: firms accept EPS-accretive but NPV-negative projects, and reject EPS-dilutive but NPV-positive projects. Both generate investment distortions, but through different mechanisms.</li>
