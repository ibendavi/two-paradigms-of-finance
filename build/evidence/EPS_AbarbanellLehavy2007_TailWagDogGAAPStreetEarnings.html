    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's 2007 <em>Contemporary Accounting Research</em> paper challenges the widely accepted conclusion from Bradshaw &amp; Sloan (2002) and Brown &amp; Sivakumar (2003) that &quot;Street&quot; earnings (from I/B/E/S) are more informative than GAAP earnings (from Compustat). Using 159,220 firm-quarter observations from 1985-1998, they show that the apparent superiority of Street earnings in pricing regressions is driven by three overlooked distributional properties of the earnings difference (I/B/E/S minus Compustat): (1) an extreme negative tail with no symmetric positive counterpart (skewness = -3.27, kurtosis = 116.85), (2) a regime shift in mean earnings differences around 1990-1991 (coinciding with I/B/E/S procedural changes), and (3) a high frequency of exactly zero differences (51.7% of observations). The central finding: when the ~5% of observations in the most extreme negative tail (portfolio 1) are excluded, the ERC gap between Street and GAAP earnings largely disappears -- ERCs become 1.10 vs. 1.04 (statistically indistinguishable). The apparent time trend in Street ERC superiority also vanishes: within the 1992-98 subperiod, the correlation of ERC difference with time is 0.14 (p=0.76), compared to 0.88 (p=0.00) when the 1985-91 period is included. The title captures the paper's thesis: a small &quot;tail&quot; of extreme observations &quot;wags the dog&quot; of conclusions about which earnings definition the market prefers. For the EPS project, this paper complicates the Bradshaw &amp; Sloan narrative but does not undermine the EPS paradigm -- if anything, it shows that for the vast majority (95%) of firm-quarters, GAAP and Street earnings convey similar information, and the market responds similarly to both.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Section 1: The Three Properties of Earnings Difference Distributions (pp. 675-685)</h3>
<p><strong>The setup:</strong> &quot;Earnings differences&quot; = I/B/E/S actual EPS minus Compustat EPS (quarterly, deflated by stock price). When I/B/E/S &gt; Compustat, the difference is negative (I/B/E/S excludes a negative item that Compustat includes).</p>
<p><strong>Property 1 -- Extreme negative tail:</strong> The distribution of earnings differences is dramatically left-skewed (skewness = -3.27, kurtosis = 116.85). There are many observations where I/B/E/S earnings are MUCH higher than Compustat (large negative differences reflecting excluded charges), but no symmetric positive tail. Mean = -0.171, median = 0.</p>
<p><strong>Property 2 -- Regime shift around 1990-1991:</strong> Mean earnings differences are near zero or slightly positive in 1985-1989, then jump sharply negative in 1990 (-0.180) and remain negative thereafter. This coincides with documented procedural changes at I/B/E/S in 1989-1991 (confirmed through conversations with I/B/E/S officials). The shift is discrete, not gradual.</p>
<p><strong>Property 3 -- High frequency of zeros:</strong> 51.7% of observations have identical I/B/E/S and Compustat earnings. These observations, by definition, cannot distinguish between the two earnings measures, yet they comprise over half the sample in prior studies.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Data and Methodology (pp. 685-690)</h3>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> 8,651 firms, 159,220 firm-quarter observations, 1985-1998. I/B/E/S, Compustat, CRSP.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings difference portfolios:</strong> Observations sorted into 10 portfolios by magnitude of earnings difference, plus a separate &quot;zero difference&quot; portfolio. Portfolio 1 = most extreme negative differences (I/B/E/S &gt;&gt; Compustat); portfolio 10 = most extreme positive.</p>

<p><strong>The critical insight:</strong> The entire ERC gap between Street and GAAP earnings is concentrated in portfolio 1 -- the ~5% of observations with the most extreme negative earnings differences. For the remaining 95% of observations, I/B/E/S and Compustat ERCs are statistically indistinguishable.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Panel A shows the familiar ERC divergence starting ~1991. Panel B (excluding portfolio 1) shows the divergence largely eliminated -- both ERCs increase together after 1991.</p>

<p>The apparent increasing superiority of Street earnings over time is entirely driven by the regime shift between 1991 and 1992, not by a gradual trend. Within the post-shift period, there is NO trend.</p>

<p>Panel D is particularly striking: when both measures beat forecasts but Compustat earnings exceed I/B/E/S (meaning I/B/E/S excluded a positive item), the Compustat ERC (2.77) far exceeds the I/B/E/S ERC (1.60). This directly contradicts the &quot;Street earnings are always more informative&quot; narrative.</p>
<h3>Section 4.4: The High Frequency of Zero Earnings Differences (pp. 700-702)</h3>
<p>Zero-difference observations comprise 51.7% of the sample. By construction, these observations cannot differentiate between the two earnings measures. Yet prior studies include them, letting a small tail of extreme observations drive conclusions about which earnings definition the market &quot;prefers&quot; while the majority of the data is uninformative on this question.</p>
<p>Additional complication: firms with zero earnings differences have systematically worse performance (lower earnings, cash flows, returns) and a disproportionate share of loss firms (20% report I/B/E/S losses vs. 13% in negative-difference and 8% in positive-difference groups). Loss firms attenuate ERCs due to nonlinear price-earnings relationships (Hayn 1995), potentially confounding portfolio-level comparisons.</p>
<h3>Appendix 1: Value-Relevance with Book Values (Table 7, pp. 710-716)</h3>
<p><strong>Table 7:</strong> Price-level regressions including both earnings and book values. Key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>In portfolio 1 (extreme negative tail), R-squared is LOWEST -- these are the observations with the most measurement error</li>
<li>For portfolio 10 (I/B/E/S &lt; Compustat, positive differences), Compustat R-squared (0.50) exceeds I/B/E/S R-squared (0.38) -- Compustat is MORE value-relevant when I/B/E/S adjusts earnings downward</li>
<li>When I/B/E/S adjusts extreme negative items, book value does NOT increase its coefficient to compensate, suggesting the excluded items have little persistent value-relevance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Appendix 2: FDP Earnings vs. Pro Forma Earnings (pp. 716-718)</h3>
<p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> Financial Data Provider (FDP) earnings (I/B/E/S, Zacks, First Call) are NOT the same as firms' self-reported pro forma earnings. Only ~11% of I/B/E/S-covered firms actually report pro forma earnings (Bhattacharya et al. 2003). Pro forma earnings match FDP Street earnings only ~59% of the time (Johnson &amp; Schwartz 2005). Extrapolating from FDP vs. GAAP studies to pro forma vs. GAAP conclusions is inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Section 5: Summary and Conclusions (pp. 706-710)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In this paper we examine three properties of distributions of differences in reported earnings across financial data providers... We demonstrate analytically and empirically that statistical results in the literature provide only weak support for either [the earnings inflation or more informative] views of Street earnings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key methodological lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Researchers must account for extreme tail observations when comparing earnings measures</li>
<li>The 1990-91 regime shift must be distinguished from gradual trends</li>
<li>Zero-difference observations (the majority) are uninformative for distinguishing the two views</li>
<li>FDP earnings are not reliable proxies for firms' self-reported pro forma earnings</li>
</ol>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Complicates But Does Not Undermine the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy show that the GAAP vs. Street distinction matters much less than Bradshaw &amp; Sloan suggested -- for 95% of observations, both measures are similarly priced. For the EPS paradigm, this is actually GOOD news: it means the &quot;which EPS?&quot; question is less important than it appears. Whether investors capitalize GAAP EPS or Street EPS, the pricing mechanism (P = EPS x P/E) works similarly in most cases. The distinction only matters for the small fraction of firm-quarters with extreme one-time charges.</p>
<h3>2. The Regime Shift Reflects Institutional Evolution, Not Market Learning</h3>
<p>The 1990-91 regime shift coincides with I/B/E/S procedural changes, not with a change in how investors process information. This means the growing GAAP-Street gap documented by Bradshaw &amp; Sloan partly reflects changes in how data providers DEFINE earnings, not changes in how markets USE earnings. The EPS paradigm's pricing mechanism was stable throughout -- what changed was the data infrastructure.</p>
<h3>3. The &quot;Tail&quot; Contains the Most EPS-Relevant Observations</h3>
<p>Portfolio 1 -- the extreme negative tail where I/B/E/S &gt;&gt; Compustat -- contains firms with large restructuring charges, write-downs, and other items that managers exclude from their headline EPS. These are precisely the cases where the Bradshaw &amp; Sloan (2002) Table 5 evidence applies: managers proactively highlight Street earnings when there are large excluded items. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's finding that these observations drive the statistical results is consistent with both papers: the GAAP-Street distinction matters MOST for firms with big one-time charges and LEAST for the typical firm.</p>
<h3>4. Compustat Can Be MORE Informative Than I/B/E/S</h3>
<p>Table 6 Panel D's finding that Compustat ERC (2.77) exceeds I/B/E/S ERC (1.60) when I/B/E/S excludes a positive item challenges the blanket superiority of Street earnings. This suggests that I/B/E/S adjustments sometimes REDUCE informativeness -- the data provider's judgment about what to exclude is not always correct. For the EPS paradigm, this implies that the &quot;EPS&quot; investors capitalize is not simply whatever I/B/E/S reports, but a more nuanced concept of sustainable earnings that sometimes aligns with GAAP.</p>
<h3>5. The Zero-Difference Majority Supports EPS Capitalization</h3>
<p>The fact that 51.7% of firm-quarters have identical GAAP and Street earnings means that for the MAJORITY of firm-quarters, the EPS paradigm's P = EPS x P/E is unambiguous -- there is only one EPS number, and both databases agree on it. The GAAP-Street debate, while intellectually important, applies to less than half of observations.</p>
<h3>6. Loss Firms as a Confound</h3>
<p>The finding that loss firms disproportionately cluster in the zero-difference portfolio (20% loss rate vs. 8-13% elsewhere) and attenuate ERCs connects to the broader issue of how the EPS paradigm handles losses. Loss firms may be priced on book value, revenue, or other metrics rather than earnings -- a limitation of the P = EPS x P/E framework that applies regardless of whether GAAP or Street earnings are used.</p>
<h3>7. Methodological Lessons for Empirical EPS Research</h3>
<p>For any empirical work testing the EPS paradigm using earnings data, Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy provide critical warnings: (a) results may be driven by extreme tails, (b) structural breaks in data definitions can masquerade as trends, (c) including zero-difference observations dilutes tests, and (d) FDP-reported earnings differ from firms' self-reported pro forma earnings.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Bradshaw &amp; Sloan (2002)</strong> -- &quot;GAAP versus The Street.&quot; The paper that Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy directly challenge. Bradshaw &amp; Sloan's central result -- Street ERC = 1.027 vs. GAAP ERC = 0.081 in 1993-97 -- is shown to be driven by the extreme negative tail (~5% of observations). Excluding these, ERCs converge. However, Bradshaw &amp; Sloan's Table 5 evidence on manager behavior (shifting to Street-first announcements) is not challenged and remains important for the EPS paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Brown &amp; Sivakumar (2003)</strong> -- &quot;Comparing the Value Relevance of Two Operating Income Measures.&quot; Make similar claims about Street earnings superiority that Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy challenge. Include zero earnings difference observations (&gt;50% of sample) in their main regressions.</li>
<li><strong>Collins, Maydew &amp; Weiss (1997)</strong> -- &quot;Changes in the Value-Relevance of Earnings and Book Values over the Past Forty Years.&quot; Bradshaw &amp; Sloan argued the apparent decline in GAAP earnings relevance was due to the rise of Street earnings. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's regime shift finding suggests the decline may be even more specific -- concentrated at the 1990-91 break point.</li>
<li><strong>Hayn (1995)</strong> -- &quot;The Information Content of Losses.&quot; Loss firms attenuate ERCs. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy show that loss firms are non-randomly distributed across earnings difference portfolios, potentially confounding cross-portfolio ERC comparisons.</li>
<li><strong>Johnson &amp; Schwartz (2005)</strong> -- &quot;Are Investors Misled by 'Pro Forma' Earnings?&quot; Find that pro forma earnings match FDP (I/B/E/S/Zacks) Street earnings only ~59% of the time and find no advantage to using pro forma over GAAP. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy cite this as evidence against extrapolating FDP-based findings to pro forma earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Bhattacharya, Black, Christensen &amp; Larson (2003)</strong> -- Find that only ~11% of I/B/E/S-covered firms actually report pro forma earnings, limiting the generalizability of FDP-based studies to the pro forma debate.</li>
<li><strong>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2013)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field.&quot; CFOs define high-quality earnings as &quot;sustainable, repeatable, recurring.&quot; Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's findings suggest that for most firm-quarters, both GAAP and Street earnings meet this definition. The distinction only matters when large non-recurring items create divergence.</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005)</strong> -- &quot;The Economic Implications of Corporate Financial Reporting.&quot; 67.1% say EPS is very important. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's finding that GAAP and Street EPS are identical for 51.7% of firm-quarters means the &quot;which EPS?&quot; question is moot for the majority of cases managers face.</li>
<li><strong>Burgstahler &amp; Dichev (1997)</strong> -- &quot;Earnings Management to Avoid Earnings Decreases and Losses.&quot; The zero-earnings-threshold results. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's finding about loss firms in the zero-difference portfolio raises questions about which earnings definition is used in threshold tests.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> -- Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy's findings are reassuring for the EPS paradigm: the GAAP-Street distinction, while real, is quantitatively important only for a small fraction of firm-quarters. For most observations, there is one EPS that both databases agree on, and the market prices it similarly regardless of source. The P = EPS x P/E framework applies to both definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x PE)</strong> -- The investor-side paper models P = E(EPS) x P/E. Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy show that for the median firm-quarter, E(EPS) is unambiguous (GAAP = Street). The &quot;which EPS?&quot; complication applies mainly to firms with large non-recurring charges -- a subset where the P/E multiple would also need adjustment.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> -- The GAAP-Street debate is itself evidence of the EPS paradigm's importance: the financial ecosystem (data providers, analysts, managers, researchers) devotes enormous attention to defining and measuring the &quot;right&quot; EPS because EPS is the number that gets capitalized. Whether Bradshaw &amp; Sloan or Abarbanell &amp; Lehavy are correct about which definition &quot;wins&quot; is secondary to the shared premise that EPS-based pricing is the framework everyone uses.</li>
