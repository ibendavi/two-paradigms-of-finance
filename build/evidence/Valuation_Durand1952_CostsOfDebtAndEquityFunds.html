    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>David Durand's 1952 NBER conference paper is THE intellectual precursor to Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958). Durand presents two competing methods of capitalizing earnings — the &quot;Net Income Method&quot; (NI) and the &quot;Net Operating Income Method&quot; (NOI) — and shows they have &quot;radically different implications for financial policy.&quot; The NI Method is the traditional practitioner approach: capitalize net income (after interest) at a constant rate, so that leverage INCREASES total firm value. The NOI Method is the theoretical approach: capitalize net operating income at a constant rate, so that leverage has NO effect on total firm value. This is EXACTLY the MM debate, six years before MM (1958). Crucially, Durand frames the entire paper around the EPS accretion/dilution test, explicitly uses the earnings yield as the cost of equity, and proposes replacing &quot;maximize income&quot; with &quot;maximize investment value&quot; — the same paradigm shift that Solomon (1963) would later formalize with Ford Foundation backing.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>I. Basic Considerations: From Maximizing Income to Maximizing Value (pp. 215-218)</h3>
<p>Durand opens by proposing a fundamental revision to economic theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This paper is unorthodox, however, in its conception of what actually constitutes a businessman's best interest. Instead of accepting the common dictum that the businessman's interest is to maximize his income, this paper counters with the alternative proposal that the businessman should try to maximize his wealth.&quot; (p. 216)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He demonstrates the problem with income maximization using a worked example: Operation B earns $10,000 in perpetuity; Operation C earns $7,000 rising to $10,500. Maximizing income favors C, but at discount rates above 9%, B has higher present value. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The statement, 'The businessman tries to maximize his income,' was changed to read, 'The businessman tries to maximize the discounted value of his future income.'&quot; (p. 217)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the paradigm shift that Solomon (1963) would later frame as the move from &quot;maximization of long-run earnings&quot; to &quot;maximize wealth or net present worth.&quot; Durand is articulating it eleven years earlier.</p>
<h3>The ABC Manufacturing Example: EPS Accretion Test (pp. 219-222)</h3>
<p>Durand's first worked example is a pure EPS accretion/dilution calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC Manufacturing: 1M shares at $15, EPS = $2.50 (P/E = 6, earnings yield = 16.7%)</li>
<li>Proposed expansion: $10M via 4% bonds, expected to earn $800,000 (8% return)</li>
<li>Result: EPS rises from $2.50 to $2.90 (16% EPS accretion)</li>
</ul>
<p>But Durand shows this EPS accretion may be illusory. If the capitalization rate rises from 12.5% (8x earnings) to 15% (6⅔x earnings) due to increased leverage risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earnings per share after expansion: $2.90
Multiplier: 6⅔
Investment value: $19.33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Value FALLS from $20.00 to $19.33 despite EPS RISING from $2.50 to $2.90. This is the core tension between the EPS paradigm and the NPV paradigm: EPS accretion does not guarantee value creation if the P/E multiple contracts.</p>
<h3>Required Return = The Earnings Yield (pp. 221-222)</h3>
<p>Durand derives the required return (RR) for equity financing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Required value of stock per share: $20.00
Capitalization rate: .15
Required net earnings, per share: $3.00
Required earnings, 1,000,000 shares: $3,000,000
Earnings previously available: $2,500,000
Additional earnings required: $500,000
Required earnings before interest: $900,000
<strong>Rate of required earnings: 9%</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The RR for bond-financed expansion = 9%, which is the earnings yield ADJUSTED for leverage risk. For equity-financed expansion via new shares at $20:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the new investment would have to earn $1,250,000 or 12½ percent to avoid dilution of earnings. Hence 12½ percent is the RR.&quot; (p. 222)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The RR for equity = the earnings yield.</strong> This is the EPS paradigm's cost of equity, derived from the EPS non-dilution condition.</p>
<h3>II. Two Methods of Capitalizing Earnings: The NOI vs. NI Debate (pp. 225-233)</h3>
<p>This is the intellectual heart of the paper and the direct precursor to MM (1958).</p>
<p><strong>The PDQ Manufacturing Company</strong> (p. 226): $30M total assets, $5M bonds at 4%, 1.5M shares at $10, NOI = $2M, Interest = $200K, Net income = $1.8M.</p>
<p><strong>NOI Method</strong> (p. 227):</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize NOI at 10%: Total value = $20M (constant regardless of leverage)</li>
<li>Subtract bonds at par: Equity value = $15M</li>
<li>Value per share = $10.00</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NI Method</strong> (p. 227):</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize net income ($1.8M) at 10%: Equity = $18M</li>
<li>Add bonds at par: Total value = $23M</li>
<li>Value per share = $12.00</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the NI Method, leverage INCREASES total value:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The most obvious difference between the two methods is that the NI Method results in a higher total investment value and a higher value for the common stock... The NI Method, it will appear, takes a very sanguine view of the risks incurred in business borrowing; the NOI Method takes a more sober view.&quot; (p. 228)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chart 3</strong> (p. 229) is one of the most important figures in the history of finance: the NOI method as a flat horizontal line at $20M, versus the NI method as an upward-sloping line showing value increasing with leverage.</p>
<h3>Graham &amp; Dodd on Leverage and EPS (p. 230)</h3>
<p>Durand explicitly cites Graham &amp; Dodd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, in their book, Security Analysis (McGraw-Hill Book Co., second edition, 1940, p. 542), show the effect of indebtedness on earnings by comparing two hypothetical companies.&quot; (p. 230)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham &amp; Dodd's argument: &quot;Would it not be fair to assume that the greater sensitivity of Company B to a possible decline in profits is offset by its greater sensitivity to a possible increase?&quot; — i.e., leverage increases EPS volatility symmetrically, so moderate leverage is acceptable if interest coverage is adequate.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Super Premium for Safety&quot; Compromise (pp. 231-233)</h3>
<p>Durand proposes a middle ground: restricted investors (banks, insurance companies) are legally constrained to buy bonds, creating a &quot;super premium for safety&quot; — bonds trade above their fair value. This allows leverage to increase total value EVEN under the NOI framework, because bonds are overpriced by constrained buyers.</p>
<p>This is a proto-MM argument about market segmentation, and it anticipates the modern &quot;clientele&quot; explanation for why leverage can matter.</p>
<p><strong>Chart 4</strong> (p. 232) shows five curves from &quot;No Super Premium&quot; (NOI) to &quot;6% Super Premium&quot; (NI), illustrating that the two methods are endpoints of a continuum.</p>
<h3>The Required Return Table: NI vs. NOI (p. 234)</h3>
<p>The key table for the EPS project:</p>

<p>Under the NI Method, bond-financed investment need only earn the bond rate (4%); under the NOI Method, it must earn the overall capitalization rate (10%). <strong>But for stock financing, all methods agree: RR = 10% = the earnings yield.</strong> This is the EPS paradigm's cost of equity, and it holds regardless of one's view on leverage.</p>
<h3>Capitalization Rate Formulas (pp. 233, 235)</h3>
<p>Under the NOI Method, the implied capitalization rate for common stock earnings rises with leverage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1 - P) / (10 - 25P)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where P = proportion of NOI paid as bond interest. Under the NI Method, the capitalization rate stays constant at 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Chart 5</strong> (p. 235) shows these three curves — the NOI method's equity capitalization rate rising steeply with leverage, the NI method flat at 10%, and a compromise between them. This is EXACTLY what MM (1958) would formalize as Proposition II: k_e = k_0 + (k_0 - k_d)(D/E).</p>
<h3>Tax Effects: Even NOI Supports Leverage (pp. 235-237)</h3>
<p>With a 40% corporate tax rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total investment value by NOI Method (with $5M bonds): <strong>$20,800,000</strong> (vs. $20M unlevered)
Total investment value by NI Method (with $5M bonds): <strong>$23,800,000</strong> (vs. $20M unlevered)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the NOI Method produces a value gain from leverage due to the tax shield! This anticipates MM (1963) by eleven years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the cost of stock financing is roughly equal to the earnings-price ratio for common stocks&quot; (p. 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the single most important sentence for the EPS project from this paper: Durand explicitly states that the NI Method implies the cost of equity = the earnings yield (E/P).</p>
<h3>Implications for Business Cycle Theory (p. 239)</h3>
<p>A remarkable passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;if the NOI Method should be rigidly accepted, the interest rate would lose virtually all its significance, and in place of it the stock rate (earnings-price ratio) would emerge as the number one determinant of investment on the cost side.&quot; (p. 239)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Durand is saying: if the cost of capital is driven by the earnings yield rather than the interest rate, then monetary policy (which targets the interest rate) has limited power over investment. The earnings yield — driven by stock prices — becomes the key variable. This directly supports the EPS paradigm's view of the monetary policy channel.</p>
<p>He connects this to Keynes (General Theory, p. 316): Keynes was &quot;probably right, but perhaps for the wrong reason&quot; that easy money doesn't stimulate investment in depressions. It's not because the &quot;marginal efficiency of capital&quot; collapses — it's because the earnings yield (cost of equity) is extremely high when stock prices are low.</p>
<h3>The EPS Non-Dilution Test in Practice (pp. 240-242)</h3>
<p>The XYZ Company example (p. 241): stock at $23, EPS = $3.00, P/E = 7.66, earnings yield = 13.04%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The simplest solution is to calculate a 'market capitalization rate' by dividing the market price of 23 into the per share earnings of $3.00. The result is 13.04 percent, or 7.66 times earnings.&quot; (p. 240)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To raise $5M by selling 250,000 new shares at $20 net: the new investment must earn $1,250,000 before tax, or <strong>25 percent</strong> on the $5M. This is the earnings yield grossed up for taxes: 13.04% / (1 - 0.40) = 21.7% (approximately).</p>
<p>Key insight (p. 242):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For debt-free companies selling stock on the open market, the RR will be the same regardless of what capitalization rate is used.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the cost of equity is the earnings yield, full stop, regardless of one's theoretical position on leverage and valuation methodology.</p>
<h3>Discussion: Davenport (NYU) — Practitioners Use the NI Method (pp. 254-261)</h3>
<p>Martin Davenport's discussion is enormously revealing about actual practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it is common knowledge that a 'leveraged' common stock will sell at a lower multiple of earnings than an 'unleveraged' common stock of the same company.&quot; (p. 255)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it would be difficult to find one who in practice uses the pure 'net income' method of appraising common stocks.&quot; (p. 256)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the simpler test of whether financing is advantageous (p. 257):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By far the simpler alternative, and one designed to show whether the transaction is likely to appear beneficial in the near future, is the method based on current market appraisal of current earnings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This IS the EPS accretion test. Davenport is describing how practitioners evaluate financing decisions: compare the return on new investment to the earnings yield.</p>
<p>The Sears, Roebuck example (pp. 258-259): Sears earned $4.80/share, stock at $40, capitalization rate = 12%. Reinvested capital earned 12.3-15.3%. Since the return exceeds the earnings yield, reinvestment was EPS-accretive and beneficial.</p>
<p>Davenport on the tax shield (p. 259):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a company financed entirely by interest-bearing debt would be worth 61 percent more than an all-stock company, assuming a 38 percent tax rate&quot; (p. 256)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the agency problem (p. 260):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;earnings have been retained and reinvested in the business merely because they were available, without the necessity either of demonstrating the wisdom of their intended use or of facing the verdict that the market would render were additional stock offered for sale.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the interests of management are distinguishable from those of stockholders, in that management has incentives to increase the size of a corporation and to build up its working capital beyond the point to which such actions represent profitable use of stockholders' capital.&quot; (p. 260)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This anticipates Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976) by 24 years and Myers &amp; Majluf (1984) by 32 years.</p>
<h3>Discussion: Anderson (Fed Reserve Bank of Philadelphia) (pp. 248-253)</h3>
<p>Anderson's key contribution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The net-operating-income and the net-income methods represent the same principle or system of security valuation. Both employ the method of capitalizing the net income available to one or more groups of claimants against the assets of the business.&quot; (p. 252)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anderson argues the NOI vs. NI debate is overdrawn — both methods capitalize earnings; they just do it at different levels (firm vs. equity). He also notes that Irving Fisher (1907, 1930) had already developed the theoretical framework for time preference and risk that Durand calls for.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The NI Method IS the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Durand's &quot;Net Income Method&quot; — capitalize net income (earnings after interest) at a constant rate — IS the EPS paradigm's valuation approach. Under NI: V_equity = Net Income / k_e, where k_e is constant. Leverage increases net income per share (by substituting cheap debt for expensive equity), so leverage increases equity value. This is trading on equity. This is EPS maximization. Durand presents it as one of two competing intellectual traditions, with the NOI as its rival. MM (1958) would prove NOI correct in perfect markets, but the NI method is what practitioners actually used.</p>
<h3>2. The Cost of Equity IS the Earnings Yield — Unanimously</h3>
<p>The most remarkable feature of this paper: ALL methods agree that the cost of equity for stock-financed expansion = the earnings yield. The NI vs. NOI debate is about the cost of DEBT financing (bond rate vs. earnings yield). For equity, the earnings yield is the hurdle rate under every framework. This is stated on p. 234, p. 237, and p. 242. Even Durand, who leans toward NOI, cannot escape the earnings yield as the cost of equity.</p>
<h3>3. The Paper That MM (1958) Formalized</h3>
<p>MM (1958) is a formalization of Durand's NOI Method with an arbitrage proof. Durand presents the NOI method as one option; MM prove it's the only consistent option in perfect markets. But Durand also shows that taxes, market segmentation, and institutional constraints make the NI method partly correct — which is exactly what MM (1963) would concede with their tax correction. The entire MM literature is a response to Durand (1952).</p>
<h3>4. Chart 6: The Earnings Yield Spread IS the ERP</h3>
<p>Chart 6 (p. 238) plots S&amp;P industrial stock yields (the earnings yield) against high-grade bond yields from 1926-1949. This IS the equity risk premium as the EPS paradigm defines it: the spread between the earnings yield and the bond yield. Durand presents it as a descriptive fact about capital costs, not as a &quot;puzzle.&quot;</p>
<h3>5. Monetary Policy Channeled Through the Earnings Yield</h3>
<p>Durand's insight (p. 239) that &quot;the stock rate (earnings-price ratio) would emerge as the number one determinant of investment on the cost side&quot; if the NOI Method is accepted — this is directly relevant to the EPS and monetary policy paper. If firms use the earnings yield as their cost of capital, then monetary policy affects investment through stock prices (which move the earnings yield), not through the interest rate channel.</p>
<h3>6. Agency Problem and Pecking Order — Again</h3>
<p>Like Dean (1951), Durand's discussant Davenport documents the agency problem and pecking order decades before they were &quot;discovered.&quot; Managers retain and reinvest earnings &quot;merely because they were available&quot;; management interests diverge from stockholder interests. These are observations about business practice, not theoretical models requiring information asymmetry.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — MM's Proposition I (total value independent of leverage in perfect markets) IS Durand's NOI Method, proved rigorously. MM's Proposition II (equity cost rises linearly with leverage) IS Durand's Chart 5 NOI curve. MM (1963) tax correction IS Durand's Section 3 on corporate tax effects.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's &quot;traditional view&quot; of leverage (Chapter VIII) is Durand's NI Method; Solomon's &quot;MM challenge&quot; (Chapter VIII) is Durand's NOI Method. Solomon explicitly cites this 1952 conference. His resolution (&quot;very like the traditional literature&quot;) is Durand's compromise with a super premium.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean's &quot;10% equity cost, 3% debt cost&quot; are exactly the NI Method's inputs: cost of equity = earnings yield, cost of debt = bond rate. Dean is using the NI Method in practice.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934/1940)</strong> — Cited by Durand (p. 230) on leverage effects. Graham &amp; Dodd's approach to leverage (moderate debt acceptable if interest coverage adequate) is the practitioner version of Durand's NI Method.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> — Their &quot;trading on equity&quot; IS the NI Method: substituting cheap debt for expensive equity raises EPS and (under NI) raises firm value.</li>
<li><strong>Irving Fisher (1907, 1930)</strong> — Anderson's discussion notes Fisher had already developed the time/risk framework. Fisher's &quot;rate of return over cost&quot; is Keynes's &quot;marginal efficiency of capital&quot; is Durand's &quot;required return.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — Davenport's observation (p. 260) that management interests diverge from stockholder interests anticipates agency theory by 24 years.</li>
<li><strong>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984)</strong> — Davenport's observation that firms retain earnings &quot;merely because they were available&quot; anticipates the pecking order, driven by management convenience rather than information asymmetry.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Durand (1952) is the intellectual crossroads. The NI Method IS the pre-MM paradigm (EPS-based valuation, earnings yield as cost of equity, leverage increases value). The NOI Method IS the post-MM paradigm (value independent of leverage, cost of capital is a firm-level concept). MM (1958) resolved the debate in favor of NOI. But practice never fully abandoned NI — which is exactly the maxEPS paradigm's thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Durand's RR for stock financing = the earnings yield, unanimously across all methods. This is the cost of equity in the EPS paradigm. His ABC Manufacturing example (EPS rises from $2.50 to $2.90 with leverage) IS the EPS accretion test that the paper documents.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — Chart 6 IS the earnings yield spread. The &quot;equity risk premium&quot; is just the gap between the stock yield and the bond yield, measured directly from market observables. Not a puzzle — a spread.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and monetary policy)</strong> — Durand's p. 239 insight: if the earnings yield (not the interest rate) is the cost of capital, monetary policy's investment channel works through stock prices, not through the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Durand (1959)</strong> — Durand's reply to MM's 1958 paper, likely building on this 1952 framework. (We have this paper in the collection.)</li>
