    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Cragg &amp; Malkiel collected confidential earnings growth forecasts from professional security analysts in the 1960s — BEFORE the CAPM was widely known — and tested whether these expectations explain the cross-section of stock prices. Their central finding is devastating for CAPM-based valuation and powerfully supportive of EPS x P/E pricing: (1) the P/E multiple is explained by expected earnings growth, the payout ratio, and the variance of analyst forecasts (R² = .52-.81); (2) the simple P/E multiple correlates as well as or better than professional analyst forecasts with realized earnings growth (Table 2.23); (3) the BEST risk measure for valuation is NOT beta but the disagreement among analysts about future growth; (4) analyst expectations are quickly impounded into prices, supporting market efficiency in the earnings-expectations channel. The book provides the strongest pre-I/B/E/S empirical evidence that stock valuation works through P = E(EPS) x P/E, where P/E is determined by growth expectations and risk from comps.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Data: Professional Forecasts Before CAPM (Preface, Ch. 1)</h3>
<p>The study's unique asset is a dataset of earnings growth forecasts collected from professional security analysts at major financial institutions during 1961-1969. The forecasts were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term</strong>: One-year-ahead earnings predictions for individual companies</li>
<li><strong>Long-term</strong>: Five-year-ahead growth rate predictions</li>
<li>From multiple independent forecasters for the same companies</li>
<li>Collected by the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance (the &quot;Q Group&quot;)</li>
<li>Given confidentially — forecasters did not know others' predictions</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, these data were collected in the early-to-mid 1960s, when the CAPM (Sharpe 1964, Lintner 1965) was brand new and not yet widely adopted. The analysts' forecasts therefore represent pre-CAPM valuation practice — earnings-based, growth-focused, exactly as the EPS paradigm describes.</p>

<p>Cragg &amp; Malkiel's conclusion (p. 96):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The last column of table 2.23 shows the correlation of the simple price-earnings multiple with the realized growth of earnings. The price-earnings multiple was as good as, and often better than, the average of the analysts' predictions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the decisive interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since P/E multiples are influenced by more than forecasted growth (as will be shown explicitly in chapter 4), this is a surprising result. It suggests that whatever information there is in the forecasts gets assimilated quickly.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the EPS project: <strong>The P/E multiple already contains the market's growth expectations.</strong> The P/E IS the market's summary statistic for expected future earnings. This is precisely the EPS x P/E pricing model: P = E(EPS) x P/E, where P/E embeds growth expectations from the market's assessment.</p>
<h3>Forecast Quality: Accurate But Not Rational (Ch. 2)</h3>
<p>Key findings on the quality of analyst forecasts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Forecasts correlate positively with realizations (r = .35-.62 for long-term, .18-.40 for short-term) — analysts have genuine information</li>
<li><strong>Agreement</strong>: &quot;a great deal of diversity of expectations among individual predictors&quot; (p. 53) — Kendall's coefficient of concordance ranges from .03 to .42</li>
<li><strong>Rational expectations rejected</strong>: The narrow interpretation is rejected — forecasts are biased, serially correlated, and do not efficiently incorporate all available information (pp. 86-96)</li>
<li><strong>BUT</strong>: &quot;there does not seem to be any more information in the predictions themselves than is already contained in market prices&quot; (p. 96)</li>
<li><strong>Historical growth rates are poor predictors</strong>: Past growth (4-year or 10-year) correlates weakly with future growth (r = -.11 to .38), often worse than the P/E multiple itself</li>
</ul>
<h3>The P/E Ratio Valuation Model (Equation 3.3-18, p. 125)</h3>
<p>The theoretical foundation derives from the diversification model (an alternative to CAPM) combined with a constant-growth dividend model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P/E = c₀ + c₁ × g + c₂ × D/E + Σ risk terms   (equation 3.3-18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where g is expected earnings growth, D/E is the payout ratio, and the risk terms come from factor loadings. This is a linear approximation to the more general valuation function f(ρ, g, d/e) = 0.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY the EPS x P/E pricing model: price is normalized earnings times a multiple that is a linear function of growth, payout, and risk characteristics. The model makes no assumption about where g comes from — it could be analyst forecasts, historical extrapolation, or market-implied growth from the P/E itself.</p>

<p>The dramatic increase in R² when switching from historical data (column 1) to analyst growth forecasts (column 3) — from ~.35 average to ~.69 average — proves that <strong>the market prices expected future earnings growth, not historical growth</strong>. But crucially, the P/E already captures this: Table 2.23 showed the P/E correlates as well with realized growth as the forecasts themselves.</p>
<h3>Beta Doesn't Explain Valuation; Analyst Disagreement Does (Section 4.6.2, pp. 163-165)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is clear from our results that expected returns do seem to be related to various systematic risk factors. Equally clearly, our results do not give straightforward support to the simple form of the CAPM. It would appear that systematic risk is not entirely captured by single measures of covariance with the market index.&quot; (p. 163)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the most important aspect of risk for valuation was that represented by the extent to which forecasters were not in agreement about the future growth of the company.&quot; (p. 165)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best single risk proxy is s²_g — the variance of long-term growth predictions across analysts. This is an expectations-based measure, not a returns-based measure like beta. In the EPS paradigm, this makes perfect sense: if the market prices stocks as P = E(EPS) x P/E, then the relevant &quot;risk&quot; is uncertainty about future EPS, which is exactly what analyst disagreement measures.</p>
<h3>Stability of Valuation Over Time (Section 4.4.6, pp. 157-158)</h3>
<p>Valuation coefficients change significantly across years:</p>
<ul>
<li>End of 1961: Growth coefficient highest (3.07 in Table 4.9) — &quot;growth stocks were in high favor&quot;</li>
<li>During 1962: Growth coefficient drops to 1.99, dividend coefficient rises — &quot;the revaluation of growth stocks&quot;</li>
<li>1962 also saw the risk coefficient become highly negative — risk suddenly mattered more</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thus it seems clear that valuation relationships do change over time.&quot; (p. 158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the EPS paradigm's observation about P/E multiples: the market's P/E for a given level of growth expectations varies with market regime. What investors &quot;pay&quot; for growth (the multiple) is not a fixed parameter but changes with market sentiment and conditions.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Predictions Add Value (Table 4.9, p. 155)</h3>
<p>When next-year's expected earnings (Ē_{t+1}/NE) are added to the model, R² rises further:</p>

<p>Both short-term and long-term earnings expectations matter for pricing. This directly supports the I/B/E/S-era evidence that next-twelve-month EPS forecasts are key valuation inputs.</p>
<h3>Efficient Markets Confirmed Through Expectations (Section 4.6.3, p. 165)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the expectations formed by Wall Street professionals get quickly and thoroughly impounded into the prices of securities. Implicitly, we have found that the evaluations of companies that analysts make are the sorts of ones on which market valuation is based.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The valuation equation could NOT be used for profitable stock selection (Table 4.10, p. 158) — residuals did not predict future returns. The most informative finding about why: knowing what the market would want NEXT YEAR (the 1964 valuation equation) would have explained 27% of 1964 returns, but knowing the actual growth rates only explains 14%. What matters for returns is not actual earnings growth but <strong>shifts in the market's valuation regime</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Diversification Model: An Alternative to CAPM (Chapter 3)</h3>
<p>Cragg &amp; Malkiel develop a &quot;diversification model&quot; as a theoretical foundation alternative to the CAPM. The key insight: if investors hold diversified portfolios, specific risk is negligible, and prices must obey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p_j = μ_j × a₀ + Σ γ_jk × a_k   (equation 3.2-9, p. 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This linear pricing equation has the same form as CAPM/APT but is derived from weaker assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does NOT require mean-variance preferences</li>
<li>Does NOT require homogeneous expectations (section 3.2.3 shows it works with diverse expectations)</li>
<li>Is robust to prohibition on short sales (section 3.2.2)</li>
<li>Is robust to differential taxation (section 3.2.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage over CAPM: &quot;it is not vulnerable to a constraint against negative holdings&quot; (p. 118) and doesn't require the untestable market portfolio (Roll 1977 critique).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Strongest Pre-I/B/E/S Evidence for P = E(EPS) x P/E Pricing</h3>
<p>Table 4.7 shows that P/E = f(expected growth, payout, analyst disagreement) explains 52-81% of cross-sectional P/E variation. This is the EPS x P/E pricing model in action: the market sets price as expected earnings times a multiple that reflects growth, payout, and uncertainty. No CAPM discount rate enters the picture — just earnings expectations and market-assessed multiples.</p>
<h3>2. P/E Multiples Already Contain Growth Expectations</h3>
<p>Table 2.23 is perhaps the most important single result: the P/E multiple correlates as well with realized growth as professional forecasts do. This means the P/E IS the market's growth expectation, capitalized into a ratio. In the EPS paradigm, investors don't need DCF models — the P/E from comps already encodes everything the market knows about future earnings. Buying at a given P/E IS paying for expected growth.</p>
<h3>3. Beta Is Not the Right Risk Measure for Valuation</h3>
<p>The book finds that analyst disagreement (s²_g) is a better risk proxy than beta (β_M) for explaining P/E multiples. This is exactly what the EPS paradigm predicts: if pricing works through P = E(EPS) x P/E, then the relevant risk is uncertainty about future EPS (disagreement), not the covariance of returns with the market (beta). The cost of equity in the EPS paradigm is the earnings yield, not a CAPM-derived required return — and the &quot;risk adjustment&quot; comes through the P/E multiple itself (lower P/E for higher uncertainty).</p>
<h3>4. Data Collected Before CAPM Was Widely Known</h3>
<p>The analyst forecasts were collected in the early 1960s, when CAPM was brand new. The analysts were doing exactly what the EPS paradigm describes: forecasting earnings growth and applying multiples. They were NOT computing discount rates from beta. Yet their expectations explain most of the cross-section of prices. This is strong evidence that earnings-based valuation predated and operated independently of the formal asset pricing models.</p>
<h3>5. Market Efficiency Works Through Earnings Expectations</h3>
<p>The book's &quot;efficient markets&quot; conclusion (Section 4.6.3) is specifically about the earnings-expectations channel: &quot;the expectations formed by Wall Street professionals get quickly and thoroughly impounded into the prices of securities.&quot; Markets are efficient not because investors compute NPV using CAPM — but because analyst earnings forecasts are rapidly incorporated into prices through the P/E mechanism. This is earnings capitalization efficiency, not DCF efficiency.</p>
<h3>6. Valuation Regime Shifts</h3>
<p>The finding that valuation coefficients change over time (Section 4.4.6) — with the growth premium highest in 1961 and collapsing in 1962's &quot;revaluation of growth stocks&quot; — shows that the P/E multiple itself is not a fixed economic parameter. It varies with market conditions and investor preferences. This is central to the EPS paradigm: the P/E from comps is an empirical market price, not a theoretical constant derived from a pricing model.</p>
<h3>7. Short-Term Earnings Matter</h3>
<p>Table 4.9 shows that adding next-year's expected earnings improves the valuation equation. Both short-term and long-term growth expectations enter the P/E multiple. This validates the modern analyst practice of forecasting next-twelve-month EPS as the primary valuation input — a practice the EPS paradigm takes as foundational.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS x P/E)</strong> — This book provides the strongest empirical evidence for P = E(EPS) x P/E pricing. Table 2.23 shows P/E already contains growth expectations; Table 4.7 shows P/E = f(growth, payout, disagreement) with R² up to .81. Directly supports the investor-side companion paper.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Data collected before CAPM was widely known demonstrates that earnings-based valuation predated the NPV paradigm. Analysts were doing EPS x P/E pricing in the early 1960s without any formal asset pricing model.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Backward-Looking AP)</strong> — The finding that historical growth rates are poor predictors of future growth (while P/E multiples are good predictors) challenges the idea that investors extrapolate from history. Instead, they form forward-looking earnings expectations that are quickly embedded in multiples.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (Equity risk premium)</strong> — The book's finding that analyst disagreement (s²_g) is the best risk proxy for valuation, better than beta, supports the EPS paradigm's view that the relevant risk measure is uncertainty about future earnings, not the CAPM beta. The &quot;equity risk premium&quot; is observable from the earnings yield, not from a factor model.</li>
<li><strong>Malkiel (1963)</strong> — Malkiel's earlier AER paper (&quot;Equity Yields, Growth, and the Structure of Share Prices&quot;) used a limited-horizon growth model that (3.3-18) generalizes. The 1982 book is the full empirical implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934)</strong> — The Graham-Dodd approach of analyzing earnings, growth, and safety margin is exactly what the professional analysts in this study were doing. The book provides quantitative validation of the qualitative security analysis tradition.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965)</strong> — The CAPM is the theoretical benchmark, but the book's empirical findings are unfavorable: &quot;systematic risk is not entirely captured by single measures of covariance with the market index&quot; (p. 163). Beta is a weaker risk measure than analyst disagreement.</li>
<li><strong>Roll (1977)</strong> — The diversification model avoids Roll's critique of CAPM testability because it doesn't require identifying the &quot;true&quot; market portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>I/B/E/S database</strong> — This book's dataset is the precursor to the modern I/B/E/S database. Cragg &amp; Malkiel collected what I/B/E/S would later systematize: consensus analyst earnings forecasts. The book proves the concept that would become the dominant institutional data product in finance.</li>
<li><strong>Fama (1970)</strong> — The book's efficient market finding is specifically about earnings-expectations efficiency: analyst forecasts are rapidly impounded in prices through the P/E mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — Fn. 10 on p. 153 carefully notes that a positive dividend coefficient in the P/E regression does NOT contradict dividend irrelevance — it merely reflects the growth/payout tradeoff. A higher payout given the same growth rate means more can be distributed.</li>
<li><strong>Diether, Malloy &amp; Scherbina (2002)</strong> — The modern &quot;analyst disagreement&quot; literature that finds dispersion predicts low returns echoes Cragg &amp; Malkiel's 1982 finding that s²_g is a priced risk factor with a negative sign (more disagreement = lower P/E).</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's V = E/k is the no-growth special case of Cragg &amp; Malkiel's model. With g=0 and no risk terms, equation 3.3-18 reduces to P/E = constant — the flat capitalization rate of the pre-MM paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean used market comparables (earnings yields of similar firms) as the cost of equity.
