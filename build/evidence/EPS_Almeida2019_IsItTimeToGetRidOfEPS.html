    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Almeida's 2019 <em>Review of Corporate Finance Studies</em> paper is the most comprehensive recent academic call to abolish EPS as a performance metric. Synthesizing the empirical literature from 2003-2018, Almeida documents that EPS targets drive short-termist behavior across five corporate policy margins: (1) R&amp;D — firms that &quot;just meet&quot; EPS forecasts have 2.5% lower R&amp;D growth, increasing R&amp;D volatility by 25% (Terry 2017); (2) Stock repurchases — 37% of repurchase dollars are spent by firms in a narrow band just to the left of zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise (Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund 2016), with subsequent cuts to employment (5% of mean) and capex (10% of mean); (3) Compensation — 46% of equity grants are linked to EPS goals (Bennett et al. 2016), with discontinuous performance clustering around EPS targets but NOT around profit targets; (4) M&amp;A — acquirers structure deals around EPS accretion, switching from stock to cash when stock deals would be dilutive (Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma 2018); (5) Vesting equity — accelerated vesting reduces capex and R&amp;D (Edmans, Fang &amp; Lewellen 2017; Ladika &amp; Sautner 2018). The welfare cost: Terry's (2017) structural model estimates 0.1% lower annual growth and 0.5% welfare loss — comparable to business cycles. Almeida proposes replacing EPS with ROA, using multiple performance measures, and forecasting ranges rather than point estimates. His &quot;bad equilibrium&quot; framework is critical: analysts expect EPS, managers are paid to hit it, stock prices react to it — and &quot;no academic I have ever talked to about this issue advocates using EPS to measure performance... Nevertheless, using EPS and EPS targets seems to be the way the financial world works at the moment&quot; (p. 204). Open research question #2 — &quot;understand the history of EPS&quot; — directly invites the historical analysis in Ben-David &amp; Chinco's maxEPS paradigm paper. For the EPS project, this paper is the strongest expression of the academic consensus: EPS IS the operative metric (confirming Ben-David &amp; Chinco's empirical premise), but it SHOULD NOT be (where the EPS paradigm disagrees, viewing it as a robust business method rather than a distortion).</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Introduction (pp. 174-179)</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Dimon and Buffett (2018), together with ~200 CEOs, proposed that U.S. companies stop providing quarterly EPS guidance. The short-termism debate is active but contested — Kaplan (2017) notes Amazon and Tesla maintained large valuations despite negative cash flow.</p>
<p><strong>The academic consensus on EPS targets:</strong> &quot;According to Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2006), the analysts' consensus EPS estimate is mentioned by 73.5% of Chief Financial Officers (CFO) as the most important performance target.&quot; CFOs are &quot;willing to take real economic actions, such as decreasing discretionary spending or delaying a new project, to meet this target.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What EPS targets affect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>R&amp;D expenditures (Section 1.1)</li>
<li>Stock repurchases (Section 1.2)</li>
<li>Compensation-driven manipulation (Section 1.3)</li>
<li>M&amp;A deal structure (Section 1.4)</li>
<li>Vesting equity and short-term incentives (Section 1.5)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The welfare argument:</strong> &quot;This literature also suggests that the practice of chasing EPS with changes in real investments leads to long-term underperformance, and thus is likely to be inefficient&quot; (p. 176).</p>
<p><strong>The key proposal:</strong> &quot;I believe it is time to consider whether to get rid of earnings-per-share (EPS) altogether&quot; (p. 177). Proposes ROA as alternative, plus multiple measures and ranges instead of point estimates.</p>
<p><strong>The puzzle Almeida acknowledges:</strong> &quot;Investors demand a simple metric of performance that is easy to understand and that is relatively comparable across firms. Clearly, the market has selected EPS to fulfill this role, but it is not clear why such a choice was made in the first place&quot; (p. 177).</p>
<h3>Section 1.1: R&amp;D Discontinuity (pp. 179-181)</h3>
<p><strong>Terry (2017) evidence (Figure 1):</strong> The distribution of (Actual - Forecast EPS)/Assets shows a dramatic kink at zero — bunching just above, with a &quot;missing mass&quot; just below. This is earnings management at the analyst forecast threshold.</p>
<p><strong>R&amp;D growth discontinuity:</strong> &quot;R&amp;D growth is 2.5% lower for firms that just meet the earnings target than for firms that just miss the earnings target, in the same year in which the forecast error is measured&quot; (p. 180-181).</p>
<p><strong>Temporary, not permanent:</strong> &quot;Evidence suggests that R&amp;D growth reverses in the future; that is, firms that just meet the EPS forecast show higher R&amp;D growth in future years than firms that just miss.&quot; Firms delay R&amp;D, not cut it permanently.</p>
<p><strong>But volatility matters:</strong> Even though cuts are temporary, they increase R&amp;D volatility by ~25%, which reduces overall innovation efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Intangibles too:</strong> &quot;A similar discontinuity exists in the growth of intangibles other than R&amp;D&quot; (footnote 9).</p>
<h3>Section 1.2: EPS-Driven Stock Repurchases (pp. 181-184)</h3>
<p><strong>The Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson (2006) / Almeida, Fos &amp; Kronlund (2016) evidence:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre-repurchase EPS surprise (Equation 1):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>EPSadj = (E + I) / (S + ΔS)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where E = reported earnings, I = forgone interest on repurchase funds, S = shares at end of quarter, ΔS = estimated shares repurchased. This is the counterfactual EPS without repurchases.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Clear discontinuity in the probability of an accretive share repurchase at zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise. &quot;Companies that would just miss their EPS forecasts by a few cents absent executing a repurchase are significantly more likely to repurchase shares than companies that beat their EPS forecasts by a few cents without relying on repurchases&quot; (p. 181).</p>
<p><strong>37% of repurchase dollars:</strong> &quot;Almeida, Fos, and Kronlund (2016) estimate that 37% of the dollars spent on stock repurchases are spent by firms in the small region just to the left of zero pre-repurchase EPS surprise&quot; (p. 182). This is an enormous fraction — more than a third of all repurchase activity.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3 — Real consequences:</strong> Discontinuities in capital expenditures and employment growth at zero pre-repurchase surprise. The effects are &quot;economically significant, representing 5% of the mean number of employees (per millions of dollars of assets) and 10% of mean capital expenditures in their data&quot; (pp. 183-184).</p>
<p><strong>Persistence:</strong> Cuts in R&amp;D associated with EPS-driven repurchases are &quot;less persistent&quot; than similar cuts in overall sample — they seem to be reversed, consistent with temporary delays rather than permanent abandonment.</p>
<h3>Section 1.3: Compensation Targets and Short-Termism (pp. 184-187)</h3>
<p><strong>Bennett, Bettis, Gopalan &amp; Milbourn (2016) evidence:</strong></p>
<p><strong>46% of grants linked to EPS:</strong> &quot;Target goals are most commonly based on EPS (46% of the grants are linked to an EPS goal)&quot; (p. 184). This is the compensation contract evidence for why managers care about EPS.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4 — The EPS compensation kink:</strong> Distribution of (Actual EPS - Target EPS from compensation contract) shows sharp discontinuity at zero. &quot;EPS tends to cluster just to the right of the EPS goal specified in the compensation contract&quot; (p. 186). Using the McCrary (2008) test, this discontinuity is statistically significant.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5 — No kink for profit targets:</strong> &quot;There is weaker or no evidence that firms also take actions to meet compensation targets based on sales and other profit measures, such as EBITDA&quot; (p. 186). The discontinuity is <strong>EPS-specific</strong> — it does not appear for profit measures. This is powerful evidence: the distortion is not about &quot;hitting any performance target&quot; but specifically about EPS.</p>
<p><strong>How they manipulate:</strong> Firms that just exceed EPS goals &quot;have higher abnormal accruals and lower R&amp;D expenditures than firms that just miss their EPS goals&quot; (p. 187).</p>
<h3>Section 1.4: EPS Targets in M&amp;A (pp. 187-189)</h3>
<p><strong>The Qualcomm/NXP anecdote:</strong> A former MBA student shared the presentation Qualcomm's management used when announcing the NXP offer in October 2016. &quot;The presentation also emphasizes the fact that Qualcomm management expected the deal to be accretive to the acquirer's (non-GAAP) EPS immediately upon close&quot; (p. 187).</p>
<p><strong>Garvey, Milbourn &amp; Xie (2013):</strong> &quot;What Will It Do for My EPS?&quot; — paper title &quot;perfectly summarizes the hypothesis that M&amp;A is driven by EPS targets&quot; (footnote 16). Their algorithm predicts which pairs of firms in same 2-digit SIC satisfy EPS accretion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Dasgupta, Harford &amp; Ma (2018) — The deal structure evidence (Figure 6):</strong> Discontinuity in the distribution of the difference between the pseudoexchange ratio and the ratio of target EPS to acquirer EPS, right at zero. &quot;Cash deals replace stock deals right at this pseudoexchange ratio&quot; — confirming that firms switch payment method to avoid EPS dilution (p. 189).</p>
<h3>Section 1.5: Vesting Equity (pp. 189-190)</h3>
<p><strong>Edmans, Fang &amp; Lewellen (2017):</strong> &quot;Vesting equity seems to be associated with lower growth in capital expenditures and R&amp;D, and with an increase in CEO equity sales&quot; (p. 190). CEOs cut investment to boost near-term EPS, then sell their vesting shares.</p>
<p><strong>Ladika &amp; Sautner (2018):</strong> Exploit a change in accounting rules that caused some firms to accelerate option vesting periods. Find consistent results: accelerated vesting leads to lower capex and R&amp;D, with long-term stock underperformance (10% lower returns over 2 years).</p>
<h3>Section 1.6: Long-Term Consequences (pp. 191-193)</h3>
<p><strong>Is EPS management necessarily inefficient?</strong> &quot;Investment cuts that are associated with EPS targets are not necessarily inefficient&quot; — firms might be cutting negative-NPV projects. But: &quot;the available evidence tentatively suggests that investment cuts associated with EPS management lead to long-term underperformance&quot; (p. 191).</p>
<p><strong>Terry (2017) structural growth model:</strong> Using EPS-driven R&amp;D cuts, Terry calibrates a structural growth model and finds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0.1% lower annual growth</strong> due to EPS-driven R&amp;D distortions</li>
<li><strong>0.5% welfare loss</strong> relative to benchmark</li>
<li>&quot;These welfare losses are in the same ballpark as those arising from business cycles (0.1% to 1.8% loss in welfare), gains from trade (2% to 2.5% gains in welfare), or inflation (losses near 1%)&quot; (p. 192)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The mechanism:</strong> &quot;Meeting EPS targets using R&amp;D increases R&amp;D volatility. Permanent cuts in R&amp;D do not help firms meet profit targets because profit forecasts are rational and thus reflect those cuts over time. However, profit targets create incentives for managers to reduce R&amp;D temporarily in response to short-term shocks. This mechanism generates the pattern observed in the data — R&amp;D growth decreases when firms feel pressure to meet profit targets, and then subsequently increases. This effect increases R&amp;D volatility by 25%&quot; (p. 192).</p>
<h3>Section 2.1: Changing Executive Compensation (pp. 194-195)</h3>
<p><strong>Bennett et al. (2016) four proposals:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Smooth links between performance and pay (eliminate kinks)</li>
<li>Use sales/profit measures other than EPS</li>
<li>Use multiple targets simultaneously</li>
<li>Use relative rather than absolute targets</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Amgen example:</strong> In 2011, Amgen spent $8.32 billion on repurchases, &quot;mostly done in the fourth quarter, and in the absence of the repurchases the company would not have cleared the annual EPS compensation goal.&quot; In 2012, Amgen's board removed EPS as a performance metric, switching to net income.</p>
<h3>Section 2.2: Getting Rid of EPS (pp. 196-199)</h3>
<p><strong>The key insight — compensation alone is not enough:</strong> &quot;Eliminating EPS-based compensation will not make EPS-driven short-termism go away. It is a fact that just meeting the analyst consensus EPS forecasts affects stock prices (Bartov, Givoly, and Hain 2002). Given that managers are paid in stock or in stock options, even managers who act purely self-interestedly will have incentives not to allow their companies to just miss an EPS target&quot; (p. 196).</p>
<p><strong>The 0.57% CAR evidence:</strong> Stock prices are discontinuous at zero EPS forecast error. &quot;The cumulative abnormal return (CAR) from 1 day before to 1 day after the earnings announcement is 0.57% higher for firms that just meet the analyst EPS forecast than for firms that just miss the forecast&quot; (p. 196).</p>
<p><strong>Market doesn't distinguish organic from repurchase beats:</strong> &quot;The market's reaction is identical in both cases (both economically and statistically)... Firms that change the sign of their EPS surprise from negative to positive using repurchases have a CAR of 0.57%, which is exactly equal to the difference between firms that just meet and those that just miss&quot; (p. 199).</p>
<p><strong>EPS is not comparable across firms:</strong> &quot;The level of EPS is definitely not comparable across companies (e.g., an EPS of $5 a share for firm i does not indicate that firm i is performing better than a firm j that has EPS of $3 a share)&quot; (p. 196-197).</p>
<p><strong>The ROA alternative:</strong> &quot;One possible such measure is a version of return on assets (ROA)... The most important step is probably to use lagged assets in the denominator... This measure of profitability cannot be manipulated using stock repurchases since repurchases during the quarter do not reduce assets measured at the beginning of the quarter&quot; (p. 197).</p>
<p><strong>Four proposals for reporting/forecasting:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple measures of performance (EPS and ROA, or EPS and sales)</li>
<li>Forecast RANGES rather than point estimates</li>
<li>Focus on standard deviation of analyst estimates, not just consensus</li>
<li>Combination approach</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section 2.3: Comparison with Other Proposals (pp. 199-201)</h3>
<p><strong>Other short-termism proposals:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminating quarterly EPS guidance (Dimon &amp; Buffett 2018) — but evidence suggests stopping guidance doesn't help and may worsen information environment</li>
<li>Reducing reporting frequency (quarterly to semi-annual) — doesn't address EPS focus per se</li>
<li>Enhanced institutional investor control — activists increase long-term performance but haven't changed the EPS equilibrium</li>
<li>Enhanced shareholder rights for long-term holders (Fried 2015) — unintended consequences possible</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantage of &quot;getting rid of EPS&quot;:</strong> &quot;Does not require changes in regulation, or government intervention. EPS-driven short-termism is a market friction that hopefully can be addressed through market-based action&quot; (p. 201).</p>
<h3>Section 2.4: How Do We Do It? (pp. 201-202)</h3>
<p><strong>The &quot;bad equilibrium&quot; diagnosis:</strong> &quot;Financial markets and corporations are trapped into a 'bad equilibrium' in which EPS targets matter more than they should. Analysts and investors expect managers to meet EPS targets and punish them when they don't. Managers also are paid to reach these targets, both directly and indirectly, through short-term increases in stock prices. As a consequence, managers incorporate EPS targets into corporate finance decisions, and end up focusing too much on the short-term at the expense of long-term investments and growth&quot; (p. 201).</p>
<p><strong>The teaching analogy:</strong> &quot;Survey evidence by Gitman and Forrester (1977) finds that in their mid-1970s sample only 10% of firms appeared to use NPV as their primary capital budgeting tool. These findings indicate that teaching can in fact have an effect on the practice of corporate finance over time&quot; (p. 202).</p>
<p><strong>The capital structure puzzle:</strong> &quot;Although the evidence on management's reliance on NPV can be considered a major triumph for our profession in terms of changing views, one that should not be taken for granted, should we worry about the lack of inroads made by capital structure research in the boardroom for the purpose of using teaching as a tool to move away from EPS?&quot; (p. 202).</p>
<p>Almeida notes the divergence: teaching changed capital BUDGETING (NPV adoption rose from 10% to majority) but has NOT changed capital STRUCTURE (managers still use informal/EPS-based rules). This is important for the maxEPS paradigm paper.</p>
<h3>Section 3: Open Research Questions (pp. 202-203)</h3>
<p><strong>Seven research questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;What determines how managers decide among different methods to meet EPS targets?&quot; (R&amp;D cuts, accruals, repurchases — what determines the choice?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;It would also be good to understand the history of EPS. When did analysts and firms start focusing on EPS and why? I am not aware of any studies on this topic.&quot;</strong> This directly invites the maxEPS paradigm paper's historical analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International evidence — &quot;Very little international research addresses target beating.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics of cut investments — are firms cutting productive projects or not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Do EPS targets drive M&amp;A activity (as suggested by Garvey, Milbourn, and Xie 2013), or do they mostly affect deal structure (Dasgupta, Harford, and Ma 2018)?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Are there any benefits of EPS targets?&quot;</strong> — &quot;Can new theory and evidence explain why EPS targets exist in the first place and why the market cares so much about whether firms beat these targets, even when firms do so mechanically rather than through increases in performance?&quot; This is EXACTLY the question the EPS paradigm answers: EPS targets exist because EPS IS the operative valuation input, and beating targets mechanically matters because P = EPS x P/E is how stocks are priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Would performance goals other than EPS really reduce managerial myopia?&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section 5: Conclusion (p. 204)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ample evidence shows that EPS is a poor measure of firm performance. No academic I have ever talked to about this issue advocates using EPS to measure performance, let alone as the summary or most important performance metric. Nevertheless, using EPS and EPS targets seems to be the way the financial world works at the moment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Significant evidence points to the potential costs of chasing EPS targets... EPS targets affect repurchases, R&amp;D, capital expenditures, employment, and M&amp;A deals.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In this paper I have argued that it is time to eliminate EPS-based compensation and, perhaps, to get rid of EPS altogether.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Strongest Academic Confirmation That EPS IS the Operative Metric</h3>
<p>While arguing against EPS, Almeida provides the most comprehensive recent compilation of evidence that EPS IS how the financial world works. Every section documents another margin where EPS drives real decisions. This is precisely the empirical premise of Ben-David &amp; Chinco: EPS is the objective function, and it shapes capital allocation across every dimension.</p>
<h3>2. The Five Discontinuities Map Perfectly to the EPS Paradigm's Predictions</h3>
<p>R&amp;D cuts around EPS benchmarks, repurchase discontinuity at zero pre-repurchase surprise, compensation kinks at EPS goals (but NOT profit goals), M&amp;A payment structure switching at the dilution threshold, and vesting-driven investment cuts — each is a specific prediction of the EPS paradigm: managers choose actions to maximize EPS.</p>
<h3>3. Figure 4 vs. Figure 5 — The Smoking Gun</h3>
<p>The comparison between Figure 4 (sharp discontinuity around EPS compensation targets) and Figure 5 (no discontinuity around profit targets) is perhaps the most compelling single piece of evidence for EPS specifically. The distortion is not about &quot;hitting any performance target&quot; — it is specifically about EPS. This rules out explanations based on generic compensation incentives and points specifically to EPS.</p>
<h3>4. 37% of Repurchase Dollars Are EPS-Motivated</h3>
<p>The finding that more than a third of all repurchase dollars are spent by firms in a narrow band around zero pre-repurchase surprise quantifies the scale of EPS-driven payout policy. Combined with the 5% employment and 10% capex cuts that follow, this gives concrete magnitudes to the EPS paradigm's real effects.</p>
<h3>5. The &quot;Bad Equilibrium&quot; IS the EPS Paradigm</h3>
<p>Almeida's description of the &quot;bad equilibrium&quot; — analysts expect EPS, managers are paid to hit it, stock prices react to it — is exactly the EPS paradigm. The difference is framing: Almeida calls it a bad equilibrium to be broken; Ben-David &amp; Chinco describe it as a stable paradigm that has persisted for centuries.</p>
<h3>6. Open Question #2 Directly Invites the MaxEPS Paradigm Paper</h3>
<p>Almeida writes: &quot;It would also be good to understand the history of EPS. When did analysts and firms start focusing on EPS and why? I am not aware of any studies on this topic.&quot; This is exactly what the maxEPS paradigm paper provides — the historical analysis of how EPS/earnings capitalization was the dominant framework before MM (1958), was displaced in academic theory but not in practice, and persists as the operative paradigm.</p>
<h3>7. Open Question #6 — Why EPS Exists</h3>
<p>Almeida asks: &quot;Can new theory and evidence explain why EPS targets exist in the first place and why the market cares so much about whether firms beat these targets?&quot; The EPS paradigm provides the answer: EPS targets exist because P = EPS x P/E — stock price is literally determined by EPS times a multiple. Beating the target mechanically (via repurchases) &quot;works&quot; because the market prices using EPS, not free cash flow.</p>
<h3>8. The Teaching Analogy Cuts Both Ways</h3>
<p>Almeida argues that just as teaching changed capital budgeting practice (NPV adoption rose from 10% to majority), teaching could change EPS practice. But he also notes that teaching has NOT changed capital structure practice — managers still use informal rules. This asymmetry is informative: NPV replaced a less systematic approach to project evaluation, but EPS is a deeply embedded paradigm that resists academic criticism because it is reinforced by market pricing.</p>
<h3>9. The 0.57% CAR — Market Prices EPS, Not FCF</h3>
<p>The finding that the market reaction to beating EPS is identical whether the beat comes from organic performance or from repurchases (0.57% CAR either way) is direct evidence for P = EPS x P/E pricing. The market does not look through repurchases to assess underlying cash flow — it prices the EPS number.</p>
<h3>10. The Welfare Cost — Comparable to Business Cycles</h3>
<p>Terry's estimate that EPS-driven R&amp;D distortions cost 0.1% annual growth and 0.5% welfare gives the EPS paradigm macroeconomic significance. If the EPS objective function generates welfare losses comparable to business cycles, it matters not just for corporate finance theory but for economic policy.</p>

<li><strong>Garvey, Milbourn &amp; Xie (2013)</strong> — &quot;What Will It Do for My EPS?&quot; The algorithm predicting which firm pairs satisfy EPS accretion criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Edmans, Fang &amp; Lewellen (2017)</strong> — &quot;Equity Vesting and Investment.&quot; Vesting equity associated with lower capex, R&amp;D, and higher CEO equity sales.</li>
<li><strong>Ladika &amp; Sautner (2018)</strong> — &quot;Managerial Short-Termism and Investment.&quot; Accelerated vesting leads to underperformance (10% lower returns over 2 years).</li>
<li><strong>Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2005/2006)</strong> — Survey evidence on EPS as the dominant target (73.5% of CFOs) and willingness to take real actions to meet it.</li>
<li><strong>Bartov, Givoly &amp; Hain (2002)</strong> — &quot;The Rewards to Meeting or Beating Earnings Expectations.&quot; The 0.57% CAR discontinuity at zero EPS surprise.</li>
<li><strong>Gitman &amp; Forrester (1977)</strong> — &quot;A Survey of Capital Budgeting Techniques Used by Major U.S. Firms.&quot; The 10% NPV adoption rate that Almeida uses for the teaching analogy.</li>
<li><strong>Pringle (1973)</strong> — &quot;Price Earnings Ratios, Earnings-Per-Share, and Financial Management.&quot; The earliest version of Almeida's argument, made 46 years prior. Both argue EPS is the wrong criterion; both document that practitioners use it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Stern (1974)</strong> — &quot;Earnings per Share Don't Count.&quot; The FAJ practitioner-oriented version of the anti-EPS argument, 45 years before Almeida. The persistence of EPS across these 45 years is itself Almeida's puzzle.</li>
<li><strong>Huang, Marquardt &amp; Zhang (2014)</strong> — &quot;Why Do Managers Avoid EPS Dilution?&quot; The 44.8% of firms with EPS bonus metrics — consistent with Bennett et al.'s 46% of grants.</li>
<li><strong>Dichev, Graham, Harvey &amp; Rajgopal (2013)</strong> — &quot;Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field.&quot; CFO survey confirming earnings are primarily a valuation input (94.67%).</li>
<li><strong>Bens, Nagar, Skinner &amp; Wong (2003)</strong> — &quot;Employee Stock Options, EPS Dilution, and Stock Repurchases.&quot; Earlier evidence on EPS-driven repurchases; 44% of high-P/E firms explicitly state repurchases offset ESO dilution.</li>
<li><strong>Brav, Graham, Harvey &amp; Michaely (2005)</strong> — &quot;Payout Policy in the 21st Century.&quot; 76.1% say EPS is important for repurchase decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Almeida's paper is simultaneously the strongest CONFIRMATION of the EPS paradigm's empirical premise (EPS is the operative metric) and the strongest OBJECTION to treating it as a paradigm rather than a distortion. The entire paper documents what Ben-David &amp; Chinco claim (EPS drives capital allocation) but frames it as a problem to be fixed rather than a stable system to be understood.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Open question #2 (&quot;understand the history of EPS&quot;) is a direct invitation. The maxEPS paradigm paper provides the answer: EPS/earnings capitalization predates NPV by centuries, was the dominant framework through the 1950s, and was displaced in academic theory by MM (1958) but never in practice. The &quot;bad equilibrium&quot; Almeida describes is actually a very old equilibrium.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — The R&amp;D and capex discontinuities are direct evidence for the capital budgeting paper's thesis: the EPS objective function distorts real investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco, Meli (EPS and financial markets)</strong> — The repurchase evidence (37% EPS-motivated) connects to the Meli paper's documentation of the buyback boom. If a third of repurchases are EPS-driven, and repurchases have exploded since 2000, the EPS paradigm helps explain the transformation of U.S. capital markets.</li>
