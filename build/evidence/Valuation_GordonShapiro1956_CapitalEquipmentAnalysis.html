    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro's 1956 <em>Management Science</em> paper derives what will become the Gordon Growth Model: P₀ = D₀/(k-g), where k = D₀/P₀ + g (the required rate of profit equals the dividend yield plus the growth rate). The paper's primary purpose is capital budgeting — determining the required rate of profit for evaluating capital equipment investments — but its theoretical contribution is showing that neither the dividend yield nor the earnings yield alone correctly measures the cost of equity. Both are biased: the dividend yield ignores growth; the earnings yield overstates the payment stream while understating growth. When book value equals market value, the earnings yield (Y/P) equals k — the errors cancel. But for growth firms (market &gt; book, like IBM with a 2-3% earnings yield), the earnings yield understates k, and for declining firms (market &lt; book), it overstates k. For the EPS project, this paper is critical because (1) it derives the relationship between the earnings yield, the dividend yield, and the required rate of profit; (2) it acknowledges that the earnings yield is &quot;commonly used&quot; in practice for capital budgeting; (3) it shows WHEN the earnings yield is an adequate proxy for k (when P ≈ B); and (4) it explicitly discusses the capital budgeting rule of equating the marginal return on investment with the required rate of profit.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Capital Budgeting Problem (Section I, pp. 102-103)</h3>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro open by identifying four developments driving the need for systematic capital budgeting: (1) the high level of capital outlays, (2) growth in firm size, (3) delegation to profit centers, and (4) &quot;scientific management.&quot; They note that capital budgeting methods have been discussed in publications by the American Management Association and the N.A.C.A. Bulletin.</p>
<p>Four methods exist for establishing an order-preference array:</p>
<ol>
<li>The payoff period (still popular)</li>
<li>The average investment formula</li>
<li>The present value formula with the rate of interest given</li>
<li><strong>The present value formula used to find the rate of profit</strong> (i.e., IRR)</li>
</ol>
<p>The key problem: &quot;in each of these methods the future revenue streams generated by the proposed outlays must be amenable to measurement if the method is to be operational.&quot;</p>
<h3>Objective Function and Four Capital Budgeting Methods (Section II, pp. 103-104)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We state that the objective of a firm is the maximization of the value of the stockholders' equity.&quot; (p. 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The budget is set by equating the marginal return on investment with the rate of profit at which the corporation's stock is selling in the market:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It has been shown by Lutz and Lutz in their <em>Theory of Investment of the Firm</em> and by others that this objective is realized in capital budgeting when the budget is set so as to equate the marginal return on investment with the rate of return at which the corporation's stock is selling in the market.&quot; (pp. 103-104)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Dividend Yield and Earnings Yield as Measures of k (pp. 104-105)</h3>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro note two market-based measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At the present time, the dividend yield (the current dividend divided by the price) and the earnings yield (the current income per share divided by the price) are used to measure the rate of profit at which a share is selling.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both fail to account for growth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;these yields fail to recognize that a share's payments can be expected to grow, and the earnings yield fails to recognize that the corporation's earnings per share are not the payments made to the stockholder.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In comparative analysis: &quot;the conclusions indicated by the dividend and/or the earnings yield are invariably qualified by the presence or absence of the prospect of growth.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Derivation: P₀ = D₀/(k-g) (pp. 104-106)</h3>
<p>Starting from the dividend discount model (continuous):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = ∫₀^∞ D_t e^{-kt} dt (equation 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming: (1) a corporation retains fraction b of income after taxes; (2) earns rate r on book value of common equity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D_t = (1-b)Y_t (equation 3)
Y_t = Y_{t-1} + rbY_{t-1}, so Y_t = Y₀e^{gt} (equations 4-5)
where g = br (growth rate = retention rate × return on equity)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore D_t = D₀e^{gt}, and substituting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P₀ = D₀/(k-g) (equation 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solving for k:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>k = D₀/P₀ + g</strong> (equation 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Translated, this means that the rate of profit at which a share of common stock is selling is equal to the current dividend, divided by the current price (the dividend yield), plus the rate at which the dividend is expected to grow.&quot;</p>
<h3>Comparing y (Earnings Yield) and k (Section III, pp. 106-108)</h3>
<p>This is the paper's most analytically rich section. Define:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b = (Y-D)/Y (retention rate)
r = Y/B (return on book equity)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the growth rate of profit k can be written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>k = D/P + br = D/P + (Y-D)/B (equation 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the income yield:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>y = Y/P = D/P + (Y-D)/P (equation 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> y and k are equal ONLY when P = B (market value equals book value). This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>k uses (Y-D)/B in the growth component</li>
<li>y uses (Y-D)/P in its &quot;retained earnings&quot; component</li>
</ul>
<p>When P &gt; B (growth firms): y &lt; k (the earnings yield UNDERSTATES the required rate of profit). Example: IBM &quot;had had an earnings yield of two to three percent in 1955. We know that the market requires a higher rate of profit on a common stock, even on IBM.&quot;</p>
<p>When P &lt; B (declining firms): y &gt; k (the earnings yield OVERSTATES the required rate). Example: &quot;U.S. Steel was selling at one-half of book value in 1950, the high income yield grossly overstated the rate of profit that the market was, in fact, requiring on the stock.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Why the earnings yield compensates:</strong> &quot;the income yield overstates a share's payment stream by assuming that each payment is equal to the income per share and understates the payment stream by assuming that it will not grow. Hence, in this special case where book and market values are equal, the two errors exactly compensate each other.&quot; (p. 107)</p>
<h3>Capital Budgeting Application (Section IV, pp. 108-110)</h3>
<p>The rule: set the capital budget so that the marginal return on investment equals the required rate of profit k (or y, if P ≈ B):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;if the market requires, let us say, a 10 percent return on investment in the corporation's stock, and if the corporation can earn 15 percent on additional investment, obtaining the funds and making the investment will increase the earnings and the dividend per share.&quot; (p. 108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the classic diagram: a declining marginal return on investment curve crossing a rising required rate of profit curve (y or k). The intersection determines both the optimal budget size and the retention rate.</p>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro note a key caveat about equity issuance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;some other consideration may argue against a new stock issue; for example, the management may be concerned with dilution of control, or the costs of floating a new issue may be very high, or a new issue may be expected to depress the price severely and indefinitely for reasons not recognized in the theory.&quot; (p. 108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the EPS paradigm in embryonic form: management avoids stock issuance for &quot;reasons not recognized in the theory.&quot;</p>
<p>On using y vs. k for capital budgeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In determining whether the required rate of profit is above or below r', the marginal return on investment, one can use y, the earnings yield, or k, the growth rate of profit as the required rate of profit. If y and k differ and if the reasoning in support of k presented earlier is valid, using y to estimate the direction in which a new issue will change the price of the stock may result in a wrong conclusion.&quot; (p. 108)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Debt and Leverage (p. 109)</h3>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro briefly address borrowing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Borrowing is an alternative source of funds for investment. However, an analysis of this alternative requires the measurement of both (1) the variation in risk with debt, and (2) the difference between the rate of profit and the rate of interest needed to cover a given increase in risk. This has not been done as yet, which may explain the widespread practice of arbitrarily establishing a 'satisfactory' financial structure and only borrowing to the extent allowed by it.&quot; (p. 109)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the pre-MM world: practitioners use rules of thumb (&quot;satisfactory&quot; structure), not optimization. The theoretical framework for optimal leverage has &quot;not been done as yet&quot; — this is 1956, two years before MM (1958).</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. The Earnings Yield Is &quot;Commonly Used&quot; — Gordon &amp; Shapiro Acknowledge</h3>
<p>The paper confirms that practitioners use the earnings yield (Y/P = E/P) as the cost of equity for capital budgeting. Gordon &amp; Shapiro don't dismiss this practice; they show it's an approximation that works when P ≈ B and propose a refinement (k = D/P + g) that accounts for growth.</p>
<h3>2. When the Earnings Yield Works: P ≈ B</h3>
<p>The paper's most important theoretical contribution for the EPS project is identifying when the earnings yield is an adequate proxy for the true cost of equity. For the typical firm (price near book value), y ≈ k, and the earnings yield is a good measure. This validates the EPS paradigm's use of the earnings yield as the cost of equity for the bulk of firms.</p>
<h3>3. When the Earnings Yield Fails: Growth Firms</h3>
<p>For growth firms (P &gt;&gt; B), the earnings yield substantially understates k. A firm like IBM with a 2-3% earnings yield does NOT have a 2-3% cost of equity — the true cost is much higher because growth is embedded in the price. This is a legitimate challenge to the EPS paradigm: if the earnings yield is the cost of equity, how do you explain growth firms with very low earnings yields issuing equity?</p>
<h3>4. The Capital Budgeting Rule Is the EPS Rule (When P ≈ B)</h3>
<p>The rule &quot;equate marginal return on investment with the earnings yield&quot; IS the EPS-maximizing rule: invest in projects whose return exceeds the earnings yield, because such projects are EPS-accretive. Gordon &amp; Shapiro derive this as a special case of wealth maximization (when P = B), but in the EPS paradigm it's the GENERAL rule.</p>
<h3>5. The Pre-MM World of &quot;Satisfactory&quot; Financial Structure</h3>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro's comment that leverage is set by &quot;arbitrarily establishing a 'satisfactory' financial structure&quot; describes the practitioner paradigm exactly. There is no optimization of tax shields vs. distress costs — managers use rules of thumb, which the EPS paradigm formalizes as maximizing EPS subject to maintaining the current P/E multiple.</p>
<h3>6. The Concern About Equity Issuance — &quot;Reasons Not Recognized in the Theory&quot;</h3>
<p>Gordon &amp; Shapiro note that management avoids stock issuance for reasons &quot;not recognized in the theory&quot; — including dilution of control and price depression. In the EPS paradigm, the primary reason is EPS dilution: issuing shares at the earnings yield increases the share count without a proportional increase in earnings (unless the investment return exceeds the earnings yield).</p>
<h3>7. The Gordon Growth Model as the Bridge Between Paradigms</h3>
<p>P₀ = D₀/(k-g) can be rewritten as P₀ = E₀(1-b)/(k-br). When b = 0 (no retention), P₀ = E₀/k — the pure earnings capitalization formula. When b &gt; 0, growth modifies the relationship. The Gordon Growth Model shows that the earnings capitalization formula is the ZERO-GROWTH SPECIAL CASE of the discounting framework. This means the two paradigms converge for mature, no-growth firms (which are the majority of listed firms by market cap for most of history).</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Gordon (1959)</strong> — The later RES paper tests whether k depends on the dividend rate (payout ratio) empirically. This 1956 paper derives the model; the 1959 paper tests it.</li>
<li><strong>Gordon (1963)</strong> — The JF paper extends the argument to uncertainty: under risk aversion, k_t increases with t, making dividend policy matter even if r = k.</li>
<li><strong>Miller &amp; Modigliani (1961)</strong> — MM's dividend irrelevance assumes k is independent of the payout ratio. Gordon &amp; Shapiro's model is the framework within which this debate plays out: if k = k(b), then dividend policy affects price.</li>
<li><strong>Williams (1938)</strong> — Williams's <em>Theory of Investment Value</em> is cited as the classic on growth valuation. Gordon &amp; Shapiro find Williams's models &quot;arbitrary and complicated&quot; and offer a simpler alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Lutz &amp; Lutz (1951)</strong> — <em>Theory of Investment of the Firm</em> is cited for the principle that the budget should equate marginal return with the market's required rate of profit.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean is cited for capital budgeting analysis. Dean's use of the earnings yield as the cost of equity is exactly what Gordon &amp; Shapiro are refining.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon will later synthesize Gordon's work into the &quot;traditional&quot; view that cost of capital varies with financial structure — the view that MM challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958)</strong> — MM's capital structure irrelevance will appear two years later. Gordon &amp; Shapiro's observation that the theory of optimal leverage &quot;has not been done as yet&quot; sets the stage for MM's revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Harvey (2001)</strong> — Graham &amp; Harvey will show that 59% of firms use a single company-wide discount rate — consistent with using the earnings yield (a single number) rather than risk-adjusted rates.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — Gordon &amp; Shapiro provide the theoretical foundation for when the earnings yield is a valid cost of equity. The EPS paradigm's use of the earnings yield as the price of equity capital is validated for firms where P ≈ B and challenged for high-growth firms.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS and capital budgeting)</strong> — The paper's capital budgeting rule (invest if return &gt; k ≈ y) IS the EPS-maximizing rule. Gordon &amp; Shapiro derive it from wealth maximization; the EPS paradigm takes it as a direct objective.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Gordon &amp; Shapiro (1956) is a bridge paper: written by academics at MIT, it acknowledges practitioner methods (earnings yield, payback) while proposing a refinement. It sits at the exact historical moment before MM changed the conversation — showing that the earnings-based approach was the starting point, not the deviation.</li>
