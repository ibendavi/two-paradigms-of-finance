    <h3>Key Finding</h3>
    <p>Berle &amp; Means's <em>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</em> (1932), a Columbia University/SSRC project, establishes the foundational fact of modern corporate governance: the separation of ownership and control. For the EPS project, three insights are paramount: (1) Directors have &quot;power over routing of earnings&quot; — they control how much is paid as dividends, when, and to whom, making earnings per share a management-controlled variable, not a market-determined one; (2) The stockholder has &quot;surrendered control over his wealth&quot; and &quot;become a supplier of capital, a risk-taker pure and simple&quot; — the shareholder is passive, leaving managers free to pursue their own objectives (including EPS maximization); (3) Profits traditionally served a DUAL function — inducement to risk capital AND spur to efficient management — but the separation of ownership breaks this link, because the people who bear the risk (shareholders) are not the people who make the decisions (managers). This book is the intellectual foundation for Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976), but its framing is fundamentally different: Berle &amp; Means see the problem as a transformation of PROPERTY RIGHTS, not as an optimization problem with agency costs.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
<h3>The Central Thesis: Separation of Ownership and Control (Preface, pp. v-ix)</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means open with the observation that the modern corporation has concentrated economic power in a way that rivals the state:</p>
<p>The book is organized into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Book I: Property in Flux</strong> — How the corporate form evolved to concentrate ownership into passive stock certificates</li>
<li><strong>Book II: Regrouping of Rights</strong> — How legal rights (voting, earnings, asset claims) have been redistributed from shareholders to managers</li>
<li><strong>Book III: Property in Stock Markets</strong> — How the stock market transforms property into liquid claims</li>
<li><strong>Book IV: Reorientation of Enterprise</strong> — The philosophical implications: what does &quot;property&quot; mean when ownership is separated from control?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Book II, Ch. III: Powers over Routing of Earnings (pp. 200-219)</h3>
<p>This chapter is directly relevant to the EPS paradigm. Berle &amp; Means catalog the mechanisms by which directors control earnings distribution:</p>
<p><strong>1. Dividend Timing (pp. 200-202)</strong>
Directors decide WHEN to pay dividends. They can accumulate surplus in good years and maintain dividends in bad years — or conversely, cut dividends even when earnings are strong. The stockholder has no legal right to compel dividend payment (except in extreme cases of abuse).</p>
<p><strong>2. Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (pp. 202-204)</strong>
If preferred dividends are non-cumulative and the board skips a year, those dividends are lost forever. Directors can strategically skip preferred dividends, accumulate surplus, and then pay it out to common stockholders later — effectively transferring wealth between share classes at management's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>3. Participating Preferred and &quot;Parasitic&quot; Stock (pp. 204-208)</strong>
Directors can create classes of stock that &quot;participate&quot; in earnings beyond their fixed rate, or create &quot;blank stock&quot; whose terms are set by the board after issuance. Berle &amp; Means call attention to the proliferation of complex capital structures that give management discretion over how earnings are routed to different claimants.</p>
<p><strong>4. Surplus Account Manipulation (pp. 208-212)</strong>
The surplus (retained earnings) account is under management's control. Directors can charge expenses to surplus (bypassing the income statement), write up or write down assets, create reserves, and otherwise manipulate the reported earnings figure. This makes EPS a partially discretionary number — management has significant influence over what earnings ARE, not just what is done with them.</p>
<p><strong>5. &quot;Blank Stock&quot; Provisions (pp. 212-216)</strong>
Some corporate charters authorize the board to issue new classes of stock with whatever terms they choose — dividend rates, voting rights, liquidation preferences — all without shareholder approval. This gives management extraordinary power to restructure the claims on earnings.</p>
<h3>Book IV, Ch. I: The Traditional Logic of Property (pp. 333-339)</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means trace the philosophical foundations of private property:</p>
<p>The traditional justification for private property rests on three pillars: (1) the owner's labor creates the property; (2) the owner manages the property; (3) the owner bears the risk of loss. In the modern corporation, NONE of these apply to the stockholder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The stockholder has surrendered control over his wealth. He has become a supplier of capital, a risk-taker pure and simple, while the managers of the enterprise — who frequently have only a nominal ownership stake — make the business decisions.&quot; (p. 338, paraphrased from the argument on pp. 333-339)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stockholder retains only ONE attribute of ownership: the right to receive residual income. But even this is mediated by the board's dividend discretion (as documented in Book II).</p>
<h3>Book IV, Ch. II: The Traditional Logic of Profits (pp. 340-351)</h3>
<p>This is the most philosophically rich chapter for the EPS project. Berle &amp; Means argue that in classical economics, profits serve a DUAL function:</p>
<p><strong>Function 1: Inducement to risk capital</strong>
Profits are the reward that induces people to risk their wealth in productive enterprise rather than consuming it or holding it in safe assets. Without the profit motive, capital would not be allocated to its most productive uses.</p>
<p><strong>Function 2: Spur to efficient management</strong>
Profits discipline the manager: if the enterprise is poorly run, profits fall, and the owner-manager suffers directly. The prospect of profit motivates the owner-manager to work hard, innovate, and minimize waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the modern corporation, these two functions of risk and control are... performed by two different groups of people — security holders supply capital, managers exercise control.&quot; (p. 342, paraphrased)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The separation breaks the dual function of profits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the stockholder</strong>: Profits remain the inducement to risk capital, but the stockholder has no control over whether the enterprise is well managed. The stockholder's profit depends on the manager's skill and honesty, not on the stockholder's own effort.</li>
<li><strong>For the manager</strong>: Profits no longer directly discipline the manager, because the manager's compensation (salary, bonus) is only loosely tied to the firm's earnings. The manager can pursue empire-building, risk avoidance, or personal perquisites without bearing the full cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Scale of Concentration (Book I)</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means document that by 1930, the 200 largest non-banking corporations controlled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly half of all corporate wealth in the U.S.</li>
<li>Approximately 22% of total national wealth</li>
<li>Assets growing faster than the economy as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>They project that if the trend continues, by 1950 these corporations would control nearly all corporate activity. This concentration makes the governance question urgent — these are not small family firms but quasi-public institutions.</p>
<h3>Types of Control (Book I, pp. 67-118)</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means classify corporations by how control is exercised:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Control through complete ownership</strong> (declining)</li>
<li><strong>Majority control</strong> (a single party owns &gt;50%)</li>
<li><strong>Control through a legal device</strong> (pyramiding, voting trusts, non-voting stock)</li>
<li><strong>Minority control</strong> (a cohesive block of 20-30% controls)</li>
<li><strong>Management control</strong> (no single block is large enough to challenge management — the modern default)</li>
</ol>
<p>By 1930, 44% of the 200 largest corporations were under &quot;management control&quot; — the board and officers ran the company without any dominant shareholder. This is the condition under which EPS maximization (as a management objective) becomes the operative paradigm.</p>

      

      
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <h3>1. Managers Control EPS — Literally</h3>
<p>Book II, Chapter III (&quot;Powers over Routing of Earnings&quot;) documents that directors control dividend timing, surplus accounts, stock class creation, and earnings allocation between claimants. EPS is not a market-determined outcome — it is a management-controlled variable. When the EPS paradigm says &quot;managers maximize EPS,&quot; Berle &amp; Means explain WHY managers CAN do this: they have legal discretion over both the numerator (earnings, via accounting choices and capital structure) and the denominator (shares outstanding, via issuance and repurchase).</p>
<h3>2. The Separation Makes EPS Maximization Possible</h3>
<p>If shareholders controlled the firm directly, they would maximize their own wealth (present value of all future cash flows). But because managers control the firm and shareholders are passive, the operative objective is whatever managers choose to maximize. If managers are evaluated by the market primarily on EPS — if their compensation, reputation, and career advancement depend on EPS — then EPS maximization becomes the rational managerial objective. Berle &amp; Means provide the STRUCTURAL precondition for the EPS paradigm.</p>
<h3>3. Profits' Dual Function and the EPS Metric</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means's insight that profits serve as both &quot;inducement to risk capital&quot; and &quot;spur to efficient management&quot; maps directly onto the EPS paradigm. EPS is the metric that links both functions: investors supply capital because they expect earnings (inducement), and managers pursue EPS growth to signal efficient management (spur). The earnings yield (E/P) is the price of capital; EPS growth is the measure of managerial performance. The EPS paradigm unifies the two functions that Berle &amp; Means saw as severed by the separation.</p>
<h3>4. The Foundation for Jensen &amp; Meckling — But a Different Framing</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means (1932) is the acknowledged precursor to Jensen &amp; Meckling's (1976) agency theory. But the framing is different: Berle &amp; Means see the problem as a transformation of PROPERTY, not as an economic optimization with &quot;agency costs.&quot; In the EPS paradigm's terms, Berle &amp; Means describe the INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE that makes EPS maximization the operative paradigm. Jensen &amp; Meckling reimagine this as a contracting problem with a principal-agent framework — which then requires &quot;frictions&quot; (monitoring costs, bonding costs) to generate predictions. The EPS paradigm is closer to Berle &amp; Means: the separation is a structural fact, not a friction to be optimized away.</p>
<h3>5. Management Control as the Default — Supporting Assumption</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means document that by 1930, management control was already the dominant governance form for large U.S. corporations. This validates the EPS paradigm's assumption that managers — not shareholders — set corporate objectives. The assumption isn't controversial; it's the documented reality of American corporate governance since at least the 1920s.</p>
<h3>6. Surplus Manipulation = Earnings Management</h3>
<p>Berle &amp; Means's catalog of surplus account manipulation (pp. 208-212) is an early documentation of earnings management. If managers have always had discretion over reported earnings, then EPS maximization isn't just about real decisions (investment, leverage, payout) — it also encompasses reporting decisions. The EPS paradigm's predictions should extend to accounting choices, not just financial policies.</p>

        <h4>Connections</h4>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Jensen &amp; Meckling (1976)</strong> — The direct descendant. Jensen &amp; Meckling formalize Berle &amp; Means's separation as a &quot;nexus of contracts&quot; problem and derive agency costs. But where Berle &amp; Means see a transformation of property rights, Jensen &amp; Meckling see an optimization problem.</li>
<li><strong>Dean (1951)</strong> — Dean anticipates the agency problem by noting that &quot;management's own ambitions to grow&quot; and &quot;personal security&quot; override stockholder interests. Dean is documenting Berle &amp; Means in the context of capital budgeting.</li>
<li><strong>Mead (1910), Dewing (1920)</strong> — These pre-MM textbooks describe the corporate form that Berle &amp; Means analyze. The &quot;promotional&quot; literature (how corporations are formed, how securities are issued) assumes management discretion over capital structure — the same discretion Berle &amp; Means document.</li>
<li><strong>Guthmann &amp; Dougall (1940)</strong> — Their &quot;trading on equity&quot; and capital structure prescriptions assume a manager with discretion over leverage — the very discretion Berle &amp; Means formalize.</li>
<li><strong>Graham &amp; Dodd (1934/1940)</strong> — Graham &amp; Dodd write from the INVESTOR's perspective, trying to analyze firms where management controls information. Their emphasis on &quot;margin of safety&quot; and skepticism toward management claims reflects Berle &amp; Means's insight that shareholders have limited control.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon (1963)</strong> — Solomon's paradigm shift from &quot;earnings maximization&quot; to &quot;wealth maximization&quot; is an attempt to CORRECT the problem Berle &amp; Means identify: if managers don't maximize shareholder wealth, teach them to. But the EPS paradigm suggests Solomon's prescription didn't change actual behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Lintner (1956)</strong> — Lintner's finding that managers smooth dividends reflects Berle &amp; Means's observation that directors control dividend timing and use this discretion strategically.</li>
<li><strong>Myers &amp; Majluf (1984)</strong> — The pecking order assumes information asymmetry between managers and investors — a specific form of the Berle &amp; Means separation.</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (maxEPS paradigm)</strong> — Berle &amp; Means provide the institutional foundation for the EPS paradigm. The separation of ownership and control is the structural precondition: managers are free to pursue EPS maximization because shareholders cannot directly control corporate policy. The book belongs in the paradigm paper's historical narrative as the bridge between the old corporate form (owner-managers pursuing profit) and the modern corporation (professional managers pursuing EPS).</li>
<li><strong>Ben-David &amp; Chinco (EPS)</strong> — The capital structure predictions of the EPS paper assume managerial discretion over leverage. Berle &amp; Means document this discretion: managers choose the debt ratio, the payout ratio, and the earnings allocation — all the tools of EPS maximization.</li>
